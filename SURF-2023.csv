"Effects of Dietary Interventions on Treatment for Patients with Anxiety and Depression, A Systematic Review","Erickson, Rylyn; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review literature regarding the effects of implementing dietary and nutritional intervention in treatments for depression or anxiety patients. Methods: PubMed and CINAHL literature sources were reviewed regarding the effectiveness of dietary or nutritional interventions on anxiety or depression. Results: Most of the sources found a relationship between increased depression or anxiety and poor diets and supported the finding that dietary implementations such as low calorie diets, higher fruit and vegetable intakes, and visits with dietary specialists to improve nutrition intakes, have positive effects on patients with anxiety and depression. Conclusion: Dietary and nutritional interventions have shown positive outcomes in treatments for anxiety or depression. Interventions researched in the review support the findings that dietary interventions benefit patients with anxiety and depression. Further research on specifically what dietary interventions work best for anxiety and depression is necessary. "
The Impact of Psychosocial Intervention for Depression following Lower Extremity Injuries: A Systematic Review,"Greene, Sarah","Objective. To review the current literature regarding the impact of psychosocial interventions for mental health issues in collegiate athletes. Methods. Literature was gathered through PubMed and Google Scholar to identify articles about the impact of psychosocial interventions on the overall well-being of collegiate athletes. The interventions included were mindfulness-based interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy. Results. All articles in this review support using mindfulness-based interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy as treatments for mental health issues in athletes. In addition to improved mental health among the athletic population, other aspects of the athlete were improved, including pain tolerance, mental toughness, and ability to cope with adversities. Conclusion. Psychosocial interventions like mindfulness-based interventions and cognitive behavioral therapies provide many benefits that support the overall well-being of collegiate athletes. "
Comparing Surgical and Pharmaceutical Techniques for Treating Uncomplicated Appendicitis,"Normandeau, James; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature and determine whether nonoperative management of acute appendicitis provides accelerated recovery when compared to surgical appendectomy after one year in pediatric patients. Methods: Literature was collected from PubMed. Articles were assessed to determine the success rate, quality of life, hospital recovery time, or return to normal activity for the patient and/or caregiver, following nonoperative management or surgical appendectomy in pediatric patients. Results: The articles for the most part supported the conclusion that nonoperative management of appendicitis is a safe alternative to appendectomy. Relapse rates typically were around 70% for nonoperative patients. For patients who did not relapse following initial nonoperative treatment, hospital and recovery times were often shorter than patients in the surgical groups. However, when the patients who failed nonoperative management were considered, the data did not show significantly faster recovery time than the surgical groups. Conclusion: Research suggests that nonoperative management of acute appendicitis does not lead to accelerated patient recovery when compared to surgical management of appendicitis in pediatric patients MeSH Keywords: Appendectomy; nonoperative; conservative; pediatric; appendicitis "
"In Middle Aged Women with HPV and Risk of Cervical Cancer, How Does HPV DNA Testing Compare to Cervical Cytology in Detecting Cervical Cancer.","Arroyo, Aura; Parsley, Kelly","Objective: To review current literature regarding the performance of HPV and cytology tests for cervical cancer. Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar and assessed for the effectiveness of HPV and cytology tests detecting cervical cancer. Results: Most of the literature displayed support for HPV testing since it has favorable results for women being screened for cervical cancer. Cervical cytology was stronger in detecting specificity which has led to using both tests together. When different methods were directly compared, the studies favored HPV testing as the preferred method for improving the detection of cervical cancer in women with HPV, but the optimal solution was it being adjunct with cytology. Conclusion: The interventions mentioned in this review should be researched further to find that gold standard diagnosis in middle aged women. HPV screening and cytology screening together have shown promising results for women who are doing routine screenings to detect cervical cancer. "
Under Pressure: A Systematic Review of Weighted Blankets for Treatment of Anxiety and Insomnia,"Holmes, Macie; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy of weighted blankets in providing relief to anxiety and insomnia caused by a variety of health disparities and diagnoses. Methods: Using Pubmed and CINAHL, articles were selected reporting on research on the use of weighted blankets for different diagnoses. Health conditions included autism spectrum disorder, attention hyper deficit disorder, chronic pain, eating disorders, old age, and chemotherapy. Results: Most articles demonstrated a decrease in anxiety and reduced sleeping medications with the use of weighted blankets. The only side effects noted by patients was minor discomfort. Depending upon the prescription process for obtaining weighted blankets, they were a cost effective intervention that was safe for adults and children under supervision. Discussion: Weighted blankets are an effective intervention in decreasing anxiety and insomnia associated with multiple health conditions, at a relatively low cost. "
Carotenoids and Their Effects on Macular Degeneration: a Systematic Review,"Bomengen, McKenna; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature concerning the effectiveness of lutein and carotenoid supplementation in preventing progression of Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Methods: Search engines PubMed and CIHNAL were used and further assessed for associations between the effectiveness of Lutein and the prevention of Macular Degeneration. The interventions included were AREDS, AREDS2, MaQuprev, lutein, zeaxanthin, vitamin C, vitamin E, beta carotene, zinc oxide, omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, and cupric oxide. Results: Most of the literature pointed to these treatments the slowing of ARMD progression. Two studies did not report slowing of ARMD when treated with combinations of carotenoids, vitamins, and other anti-inflammatory substances. Conclusion: Results were inconclusive. Not all studies reported significant figures supporting supplements in treatment of the slow of ARMD progression. Carotenoid interventions have shown promising results for the prevention of ARMD. The interventions mentioned in this review should be researched further to provide additional treatment options. Keywords: Age Related Macular Degeneration, Prevention, Lutein, Carotenoids "
Chronic Wound Treatment Using Mesenchymal Stem Cells: A Systematic Review,"Taugher, Dominique; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature about the effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell treatment on chronic wounds. Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed, CINHAL, and Google Scholar and assessed for the effectiveness of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) treatment on chronic wounds. Results: The majority of the literature supported the stance that MSC interventions have a favorable effect on patients with chronic skin wounds. Conclusions: MSC treatment shows promising results for patients with chronic skin wounds. The treatment mentioned in this review should be researched further to discover the best dosage and further studies should examine the safety of MSCs. When different dosages were directly compared, studies didn’t identify a preferred dosage for best improving skin dermis in patients with chronic skin wounds. Keywords: Mesenchymal stem cells; chronic wounds; psoriasis; atopic dermatitis; diabetes mellitus; acute skin wounds; recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa. "
"Dietary Soy Consumption and its Impact on Male Fertility, a Systematic Review","Babin, Bailey; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature regarding impacts of dietary soy on male fertility. Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed and CINAHL and assessed for impacts on male fertility. Dietary soy products included foods that contained isoflavone phytoestrogens. Results: Of the studies in this review, two involving mice, half found that dietary soy negatively affects male fertility, while the other half found that dietary soy has no effects on male fertility. Conclusion: Further studies should be conducted with a longer duration before coming to a concrete conclusion of whether or not the presence of dietary soy, including isoflavones, adversely affects male fertility. Keywords: Fertility; isoflavones; soy products; estrogens; reproduction. "
The Impacts of Aerobic and Anaerobic Exercise on Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS) for Middle Aged and Older Adults with Alzheimer’s; A Systematic Review,"Jones, Sadie; Schafer, Gerald","Objective. To review the impact of aerobic and anaerobic exercise on neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in middle aged and older adults with Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Methods. Studies found through PubMed and CINAHL databases were reviewed for associations between aerobic exercise and anaerobic exercise affecting NPS with those with AD. There were 64 articles identified from both databases which were then narrowed down to eight qualitative articles. Results. Aerobic exercise was strongly correlated with an improvement of NPS which includes depression, stress, and aggression in studies designed with specific durations of physical exercise. In some studies, anaerobic exercise found memory training to be effective for reducing NPS. Conclusions. While anaerobic exercise influenced changes in behavioral symptoms, current research suggests that aerobic exercise has a greater impact on NPS, leading to a reduction in stress and depression in individuals with AD. "
Prevalence of Ventricular Tachycardia Reoccurrence Following Catheter Ablation in Patients With Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy: A Systematic Review,"Moseley, Marie; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To evaluate studies regarding the prevalence of ventricular tachycardia (VT) reoccurrence following catheter ablation in patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) who present with persistent ventricular tachycardia. Methods: Literature was identified using CINAHL and PubMed and evaluated for effectiveness of catheter ablation in preventing VT reoccurrence following ablation in ARVC patients with persistent ventricular tachycardia. Results: Most of the literature found catheter ablation to be an effective treatment for ARVC patients with persistent ventricular tachycardia, however, ventricular tachycardia reoccurrence was common in the majority of the studies. Across the 9 nine studies analyzed, after one catheter ablation procedure the VT reoccurrence rate was near 50%. Conclusion: Catheter ablation shows promising results for ARVC patients with persistent VT. However, further research should be done to fully establish the efficacy of this treatment. The use of improved mapping techniques could potentially lower VT reoccurrence rates following ablation. "
Hybrid Closed Loop Insulin Delivery System Treatment for Adults and Adolescents with Type One Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review,"Tuggle, Baxter; Schafer, Gerald",Objective: To review current literature that assesses the effectiveness of hybrid closed loop insulin pumps at improving time in range (TIR) and HbA1C for adults and adolescents with Type One Diabetes Meletus (T1D). Methods: Literature gathered through PubMed and CINAHL databases was reviewed for associations between HCL and improved TIR along with HbA1C in adults and adolescents with T1D. Results: HCL showed a strong relationship between improved TIR and HbA1C in adults and adolescents with T1D. Discussion: All studies showed a strong association between HCL and improved TIR along with HbA1C. These findings should influence the way health care providers treat T1D. 
Diagnosis Methods in Horses with Potomac Horse Fever,"Abernathy, Natalie; Schafer, Gerald","Objective. To review current literature on the most effective method of diagnosing Potomac horse fever. Methods. Literature was gathered from PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, and assessed for effectiveness of diagnostic methods of Potomac horse fever. Results. The majority of articles indicated that using PCR as a means of detecting Potomac horse fever was most effective. Use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was also indicated in some articles as being an effective method. Conclusion. The use of PCR as a means of diagnosing Potomac horse fever was found to have the least amount of false positive and false negative results when compared to IFA and ELISA diagnostic tests. PCR is the most commonly used diagnostic method for detecting Potomac horse fever. "
"The Effects of Intermittent Fasting Diet at Different Stages of Circadian Rhythm on Mus musculus on Metabolic Rate, Glucose and Ketone Levels, and Overall Body Fat Loss","Lohr, Kelsyn; Sheafor, Brandon","Intermittent fasting (IF) diets are popular weight loss regimens that are thought to promote heart health, fight inflammation, and reduce risk of cancer. For humans, fasting periods typically take place during the night with feeding periods during the day. However, it is unknown if this is the best fasting method in relation to a mammal’s circadian rhythm. Using laboratory mice (Mus musculus), we will study the efficacy of the IF diets at different points within a daily circadian rhythm. Mice will be placed in three groups: mice feeding ad libitum, mice fasting overnight, and mice fasting during the day. Metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, urine glucose and ketone levels, and overall weight change of the three groups will be quantified over a seven week period. Glucose and ketone levels will be tested using 96 well colorimetric assay kits. A flow-through respirometer will be used to test metabolic rate and respiratory quotient. If the time of day at which fasting occurs results in changes in lipid metabolism then we should observe significant differences in metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, urine glucose and ketone levels, and body weight between the daytime and nighttime fasted mice. "
Latina Women: Invisible Pillars of Power,"Hoelscher, Lily; Hallows, Ryan","This presentation addresses the nature of identity in specific regards to women in Latino communities, examining effects of both intercultural stereotypes and intracultural conflict on women within their groups of origin and how they are perceived by the broader world. Personal relationships with other women in their lives and with Latino men are a defining factor of this exploration and will be discussed through examples from fictional and biographical literature by Latino/a authors. As societal influences on cultural identities are further illustrated, the power – or lack thereof – of the Latina woman within family and community structures will be brought to the fore. Through recent works by Latina artists and activists revealing multiple dimensions of their own social and psychological experiences, it is hopeful that in the near future the Latina woman’s unique position will finally be seen and heard in a world that so often seeks to crush her. "
Fixing Parking Problems & Honoring Our Student Veterans,"Rector, Ryan; Christian, Patricia","At Carroll, parking for students is a challenge. Rarely are there any open “Permitted Student” parking spaces in semi-convenient locations around campus during campus peak hours. Meanwhile, data showed that there were, on average, 39 unused “Staff/Faculty” parking spaces around campus during peak hours (10am & 2pm). The proposal was a research supported proposal that was intended to fix a problem in a meaningful way with 10 of the 39 available, unused, non-assigned “Staff/Faculty” parking spaces around campus. We proposed that 10 of those 39 spaces be assigned and made available to all currently enrolled “Student Veterans.” For good measure, it is also suggested that Carroll College consider investing in some Student Veteran/Veteran Spaces in the HAC/PE Center parking lot. The proposal has received unanimous approval from every major governing body on the Carroll campus. The research conducted was not your typical college research project. It was not for any class. The study ended up being a collaborative effort between the Student Veterans Organization, Veteran Services, Campus Safety and Security, Securitas, and Facilities. Securitas conducted the 5 week data collection process. Every non-assigned Staff/Faculty parking space was counted, and recorded, per location. All assigned/designated parking spaces were omitted from the count and data collection process. Peak hours were identified prior to the beginning of the semester. It was assumed that the peak hours would result in the most impacted parking times for the campus. Thus, the parking spaces were counted twice each working day M-F, at the hours of 10am and 2pm. For each week, per lot, an average was measured per time 10 & 2. Then each lot was averaged for each time per each lot. Then every lot was averaged for each time. Then each time was averaged together to get the 39 avg. unused parking spaces at any given time of day. This average was then reduced by 10 spaces for new staff/faculty employees. Currently we have 24 student veterans enrolled at Carroll. The amount of parking spaces that were proposed was 10-12 spaces that would be assigned to only Student Veterans. These spaces were to be spread out over the staff and faculty parking lots that had the most availability around campus. Thus leaving a safe buffer of 29 unused staff and faculty parking spaces around the campus. The 10 new signed spaces for student veterans is ultimately beneficial for the entire Carroll Community. Student Veterans get more preferential parking around campus, parking around the campus will be utilized more efficiently, and traditional students will theoretically gain 10 parking spaces. Having semi-permanent “Student Veteran Parking Spaces” spread around campus is a great recruitment tool for Carroll to employ when looking to get more student veterans enrolled at Carroll. "
Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: Part I,"Wallis, Caleb; Graham, Loren","Sir Gawain and the Green Knight is a 14th century chivalric romance poem written in Middle English with a combination of alliterative and rhyming meter. Despite the poem’s popularity in recent media, this is all of what we know about The Green Knight’s history. When it comes to other popular mythological pieces such as The Odyssey, a title of distinct authorship gives these poems a defined time and style, which in turn leads to a figure of authority over the poem itself. Even many poems without an author, such as Beowulf, still manage to retain such a figure through their continued use in academic and popular spaces, as seen in the prominence of translators such as Chickering and Heaney. The Green Knight, however, not only has an absent author, but also any major figure of authority. No one owns The Green Knight in the way Homer owns the Odyssey, nor is anyone The Green Knight’s academic standard in the way Chickering’s translation is for Beowulf. This creates an immediate draw for any translator seeking to work with medieval source material, as such a lack of authority means that, through the skill and style of a talented translator, The Green Knight can be made one’s own in a way that The Odyssey cannot. In this light, I will be presenting my own translation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. This translation is in modern prose and seeks to combine both medieval and modern language with the poem’s existing alliterative style. "
“Se reconstruire” : building a feminist economy in Rwanda post-genocide,"Badaruddin, Helen; Crohas, Julie","The 1994 Rwandan genocide devastated the country’s political, economic, and social core. With around 800,000 people dead, around 60 to 70% of the surviving population were women. Just three decades after their independence from the Belgian colonial empire, the surviving women were left to reconstruct Rwanda again, and now, women represent more than 60% of their parliamentarians. However, theorists such as Briggs note that their political representation may not translate to social and economic equality. This research explores the economic implications of Rwanda’s women-led government through an examination of macroeconomic trends since the genocide. "
Social Barriers and their Affects on the Availability and Accessibility of Menstrual Products,"VanSickle, Emma; Johnson, Jeremy","Objectives: To review current literature to determine the effects of social barriers on menstrual products and menstrual health on women and individuals who menstruate. Methods: Literature was gathered from PubMed and CINHAL databases and assessed for association between menstruators, menstrual products, and accessibility. Results: The overall findings based on the information found were consistent with the conclusion that social barriers have large impacts on the accessibility of menstrual products to individuals who menstruate. All studies and literature supported the results and further explained the issues surrounding menstrual health across multiple countries. Conclusion: Menstrual health and hygiene should be seen as “health-related necessities” and yet those who are homeless, have a disability, or are from countries where menstrual health is not seen as a necessity, have difficulties accessing reproductive health care and menstrual products. By changing the stigma and social normalities surrounding reproductive health and menstruation, more individuals can gain higher education, feel more comfortable and confident during their periods, and gain higher access to menstrual products and necessities. "
An Evolutionary Exploration of Drag,"O'Reilly, Kyra; Fregulia, Jeanette","Drag, a performative art in which individuals dress in exaggerated and artistic displays of gender, has a long history and has been seen worldwide for centuries. For example, in the fourteenth century, women would dress as men to attend tournaments, and while at the time, that was not defined as drag, it can today be seen as such. Similarly, in Shakespearean theatre, where women were not allowed to act, men would dress up and play the female characters in the show. In the 1800s, the term drag emerged in the media to describe men dressing as women. In the United States in 1858, William Swan, a formerly enslaved person, became a self-named queen of drag. Despite its long history, there has been a shift from seeing drag as a celebrated art form to a perverse manipulation. In this presentation, I explore these questions: What does history have to say about drag? Why are drag performers being targeted so egregiously? What are current media platforms saying, and is this attack on drag only the start of a bigger attack on the queer community? "
"Meaning, morality, and the need for a Rearticulation of the self","Gold, Greyson; Glowienka, Edward","My research examines contemporary philosophy surrounding the moral values and meaning which make up the self. I seek to articulate what Charles Taylor labels the best account of the moral self––the system which provides the most fitting and consistent framework by which to explain the complexity of the human. I look at the works of atheist thinkers Friedrich Nietzsche, one of the founders of Postmodernism, and Jean-Paul Sartre, one of the primary existentialist thinkers, to examine some of the contemporary notions of the moral self. I argue that these thinkers fail to provide a best account of the moral self. Alternately, bringing in the thought of Iris Murdoch, Charles Taylor, and Susan Wolf, I argue that the moral self is not limitable to a Nietzschean becoming or an existential willing, but must be explained in relation to a higher telos, an object of love, an aim for moral growth, by which one can judge the goodness of one’s actions and the meaningfulness of one’s life. I also discuss the role of narrative art in articulating aspects of the moral self, arguing that effective narrative art supports my teleological framework. "
The Gentrification of Chicago as a Result of Urban Renewal: The Effect on Little “Not So” Italy and Public Housing,"Cox, Griffin; Pavlakis, Dean","Starting in the 1940s, the Urban Renewal Act was implemented to rebuild the slums in cities around the United States, with the goal of creating a new beginning. In Chicago, Urban Renewal was an excuse for the demolition of Little Italy, leading to the displacement of and disappearance of the community. The intended goal of this removal was to make room for the expansion of the University of Illinois in Chicago (UIC) campus. The Urban Renewal Act also resulted in the creation of public housing, most notably the Cabrini- Green homes. Urban Renewal targeted communities, intended or not, that consisted primarily of people of color. Some of these communities were relocated to public housing, being promised that the new housing would be a Utopia. These promises would quickly devolve and Cabrini-Green would be run by gangs and residents would be shot at from rooftops of the buildings. Urban Renewal promised a a reconstruction of the communities for the better, but resulted in worse conditions than before. "

A Headline is Worth a Thousand Words: An Analysis of Syrian Media about Refugees,"Badaruddin, Helen; Jones, Charlotte","With about thirteen million displaced Syrians worldwide, the Syrian refugee crisis remains one of our most significant global challenges. In 2015, images of Alan Kurdi, a Kurdish-Syrian two-year-old refugee, lying dead on a beach went viral across the West and dramatically increased the media attention on the Syrian crisis. Despite extensive research on how media in receiving countries, like Canada and Turkey, discuss refugees, there is minimal research on the media representation of Syrian refugees in Syrian media. This study explores headlines from Syrian opposition and government sources and concentrates on how they frame refugees. The data highlighted the power of political alignment as a gatekeeping force as the sources framed refugee stories differently based on their ownership and political-lean. Using refugee stories as a topic area allowed for an exploration of varying manifestations of nationalism that were shaped by issue framing. Opposition sources were more likely to express nationalism through sympathy for their displaced compatriots than their government-leaning counterparts. "
The Resistance Will Be Heard: Charly García’s Way of Singing an Opinion.,"Daley, Clare; Restrepo-Mesa, Sergio","The study of music can also be the study of history or revolution. A look at the representation of women in the work of Argentinian musician Charly García illuminates the attitude of Argentina’s citizens under a misogynist dictatorship from 1976-1983. According to Jacques Rancière, it is important that political messages have an art form, and, in this way, Charly García’s music is rich in archetypes that communicate his political stance. Thanks to this exercise in a rhetorical art form, the Argentinian musician’s fame gave a voice to the people who lived under oppressive dictators. With this in mind, what are the lessons woven into Charly García’s lyrics and how can they continue to influence people after so many decades? The theme of this essay is my interpretation that the women in Charly García’s songs are a representation of Argentina and the suffering the country has experienced. I will illustrate how his songs, in a time of oppression for many, were acts of resistance against an unjust and dangerous totalitarian government. In addition to this, I will demonstrate how Charly García, in order to protect himself from the persecution of the dictators, used imagery from well-known stories and fairytales to talk about issues of life and death. In conclusion, I will show how, through Charly García’s songs, we learn to have creativity and use our voice to express the messages of liberty that we carry in our hearts. "
The Role of REM Sleep in Creativity,"McGill, Anna; Bauer, Layne; Honzel, Nikki","The original study done by Carlsson et al. (2019) examined rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and its effects on creativity in college students after daytime naps or rest. This study of REM on creativity is important for students to be able to problem solve. Sleep data was recorded on smart watches worn by participants to measure total sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep. We hoped to see whether more REM sleep affected levels of creativity. Participants were asked to take 2 randomized creativity tests, including the Remote Associates Test (RAT) and an Alternate Use Test (AUT). Twenty participants each had fifteen minutes to complete the RAT test, and three minutes to complete the AUT test. Our hypothesis was that high amounts of REM sleep would positively correlate with high amounts of creativity. Participants randomly assigned to RAT A (difficult) had lower scores than those randomly assigned to RAT B (easy), while participants randomly assigned to AUT A (easy) had higher scores than those randomly assigned to AUT B (difficult). The results showed that with less REM sleep, higher levels of creativity were exhibited on the AUTs, but no significant effects were shown for RATs. "
How does School Funding influence aspects of the National General Education Policy?,"Arthur, Erika; Paris, Reagan; Prendergast, Tess; Ryan, Reagan; Gilboy, Kathy","Our group decided to research how funding influences the aspects of the National General Education Policy. We chose this topic because as future educators school funding will directly affect our classrooms, student support programs, and educational environments. We find this topic pressing in today's society after seeing detrimental teacher loss due to insufficient salaries and school budgeting. As a group, we want to learn more about the National General Education Policy and the positive and negative effects this has on state and federal funding. Through our research, we plan to investigate how funding filters into national programs such as ESSA (Every Student Succeeds Act) and ESEA (Elementary and Secondary Education Act) and the effects of these acts in all aspects of the education system. We believe that research will show that a lack of funding for these programs has had a negative impact on the aspects of education policy across the United States. "
Self Actualization Through the Eyes of St. Augustine and Zora Neale Hurston,"Karbowicz, Sonia; Greiner, Katherine","“Know thyself!” -- The journey of self-discovery is a critical road every human must walk if he wants to live a full and fruitful life. In Confessions, St. Augustine discusses his yearning for deeper understanding of joy and pleasure as his worldly desires were not enough. In Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston, Janie struggles with allowing others to define her rather than her defining herself. Both characters grapple with imposed expectations their external experiences place on them, finding no satisfying answers. St. Augustine and Hurston examine how the world places constraints on self-actualization and follow the journey of coming to define oneself regardless of past experiences. Focusing on the suffering necessary for such a transformation, St. Augustine and Hurston demonstrate how the search for self within a tumultuous world leads to a complex and deeper understanding of life. The search for knowledge must begin at the individual level as self-actualization allows for a clearer understanding of the rest of the world. "
Dangers to Human Society: Applying Aristotelian Virtue Ethics to Gulliver's Travels,"Holmes, Macie; Greiner, Katherine","According to Aristotle, individuals ought to strive to be virtuous. This idea is outlined in his Nicomachean Ethics, where he describes virtue as being the mean of two vices. In application, Aristotle’s understanding of virtue can be applied to societies as well as individuals, whether to highlight virtuous traits or the vices of the society. One place to do so is pertaining to Gulliever’s Travels, a satirical novel written by Jonathon Swift. Gulliver travels to a multitude of fictional islands and observes the societies within each. From the reader’s perspective, it is easy to identify the vices of each nation, in addition to those portrayed by Gulliver. By investigating two of Aristotle’s virtues and their vices found in Gulliver’s Travels and applying them to society as a whole, this inquiry will investigate the greatest dangers to human society as succumbing to vices which lead to an immoral society, especially when society is incapable of recognizing their faults. "
The Best Society: a Comparison of Aristotle and Machiavelli,"Wassmuth, David; Greiner, Katherine","By investigating the writings of Machiavelli and Aristotle, I will show what a just society is and how both authors believe this can be achieved. Aristotle, writing in the 4th century BC, believes that every person’s individual quest for virtue will create a just society, and that just societies can only be built in this way from the ground up. He gives a very direct route to a just society by listing virtues, explaining their related vices, then showing why the virtues are useful to a just society. In The Prince, Machiavelli provides an interesting counterpoint, arguing that to create and maintain a just society, rulers must commit unjust actions. His 16th century method of fighting fire with fire directly attacks vices present in society, but the benefits may be outweighed by the costs of reaching a just society in this way. Both authors believe that a just society is a worthy and achievable goal, but their methods to reach the goal differ greatly. Aristotle provides an intellectual and optimistic approach to a just society, while Machiavelli brings it down to earth with a more practical approach to make just societies work. This paper searches for a reconciliation of these two views, finding a common ground that both authors agree on. From that point, it may be possible to create a society that is both just and feasible in today’s world. "
What Do We Owe Our Fellow Human Beings?: Answered by Mary Wollstonecraft and Virginia Woolf,"Sargent, Ava; Greiner, Katherine","Education is a key feature of a just and equitable society. Cultivating a robust and successful education system requires knowing how to best support students from all backgrounds. Yet, that does not always happen. Mary Wollstonecraft and Virginia Woolf provide insight into how one can best support students from all walks of life, while also showcasing the effects that lack of education can have on students. In The Vindication of the Right of Women, Mary Wollstonecraft states the struggles women experienced during the 1700s. Through her recollection of women's inequality, Wollstonecraft sets up her ideas on what she thinks will be most beneficial for students within education so they have the opportunities to gain knowledge in ways that she and other women were not allowed to. Woolf compliments the ideas of Wollstonecraft as she too experienced inequality due to her being a woman in the early twentieth century. In her work, A Room of One’s Own, Woolf introduces the importance of having one’s own space to devote to their passions, as well as having the opportunity to explore new interests. Through exploration and dedicated time to her creative work, Woolf was able to gain knowledge and feel like a productive member of society. Both Wollstonecraft and Woolf desire to reveal ways in which one can support and provide for students in education because they have experienced the shortcomings of society. Analyzing their desire to support the education of women in their particular contexts offers a way to consider how to create an education system that supports all students. "
Examining the Role of Power in the Downfall of Human Society through King Lear and Survival in Auschwitz,"Goulet, Elaina; Greiner, Katherine","The destructive quality of power can be seen in both Shakespeare’s King Lear and Primo Levi’s Survival in Auschwitz. While King Lear is a fictional story depicting a family destroyed by power, the message underlying the story is very real. King Lear’s daughters, Goneril and Reagan, both fight for the power their father handed over, and in doing so lose sight of meaningful relationships, as well as the value of a human life. This leads to the collapse of the entire kingdom. The devaluing of human life due to power can also be seen in the nonfiction work Survival in Auschwitz, which retells the horrors of the concentration camps during WWII, in which prisoners slowly lost touch with their own humanity. In Survival in Auschwitz, Primo Levi shows how the power structure in the concentration camps were linked with the amount of humanity the prisoners were able to hold on to. While King Lear is fictional and Survival in Auschwitz nonfictional, both show the destructive aspect of power. This is explored in this presentation by analyzing the greed of Goneril and Reagan, as well as the struggle to survive in Auschwitz, and how these uses of power may lead to the downfall of society.

Searching for Knowledge with Descartes and Merleau-Ponty,"Wald, Elliot; Greiner, Katherine","The search for knowledge is one that many people have undergone in some form or another. René Descartes and Maurice Merleau-Ponty are both philosophers who describe this search: defining knowledge and discussing the best way to find it. Descartes’ work revolves around the notion of pure, irrefutable truth isolated through the correct use of reason. He emphasizes how applying those truths allows one to control their external environment. In contrast, Merleau-Ponty focuses on the imperfection of human perception and how accepting its flaws leads to a better understanding of oneself. He explains that this knowledge of self makes it easier for people to form connections with others, respect their opinions and work together in society. Though these two thinkers disagree about the nature of knowledge and reason, both recognize that curiosity is an inherent human quality that allows people to grow their understanding of the world. Their works suggest that by combining scientific and social inquiry, searching for knowledge leads humans to become better versions of themselves. "
Finding Meaning in Our Suffering: A Quest for Knowledge by Julian of Norwich and Primo Levi,"Everest, Cerena; Greiner, Katherine","Why do human beings suffer? Julian of Norwich’s Revelations of Divine Love and Primo Levi’s Survival in Auschwitz shed light on how suffering shapes an individual’s humanity without completely defining it. Revelations of Divine Love explores Julian’s afflictions and the revelations she receives from God, as well as how she learns to embrace suffering as a way to hold on to her humanity and to the steadfast love of Christ. In Survival in Auschwitz, Primo Levi details the gruesome journey he underwent as a prisoner in Auschwitz. Levi’s quest for survival amidst the harsh and dehumanizing conditions of the camp led him to witness the capabilities of human nature when stripped down to its bare, primordial state- profound acts of kindness alongside horrific acts of greed and selfishness. Ultimately, Levi endures suffering and holds onto his humanity because he presses in to the shared experiences and mutual understanding of what his fellow prison mates are going through. Both authors show that although suffering is an inevitable part of the human condition, it is not something that we have to walk through alone. They each come to befriend suffering as Julian of Norwich experiences a truer sense of love found in Christ and Primo Levi experiences a deeper love for human beings. "
Re-examining Social Capital in Putnam’s Italy: A Reconstruction of Putnam’s Civic and Clerical Indices,"Gallardo, Vicente; Johnson, Jeremy","In his book “Making Democracy Work” Robert Putnam details his decades long experiment in the Italian regions that revolutionized political science. In 1973 the Italian government reformed its regional governments, giving many of the regions the same government structure, similar budgets, and overall implemented a standard governing structure across the regions of Italy. Putnam and his colleagues saw reformation as a unique opportunity to observe the non-political factors that affect government performance, since the structure of the government had theoretically become a constant variable. They discovered a wealth of information and utilized cutting edge statistical methods to measure the efficiency of government and the factors that influence it. These extensive observations resulted in the core discovery of what, to Putnam and his collaborators, ‘made democracy work’: the civic community.” I reconstructed Putnam’s Civic Community Index with similar factors to the ones he utilized: preference voting, referendum turnout, newspaper readership, and scarcity of associations. This index was used in a similar manner to Putnam and was measured against other recreated indices to observe what Putnam called “clericalism.” The reconstructed index incorporates news readership, church attendance, percentage of religious weddings, and percentage of religious divorces. This information is available through the official statistics branch website of the Italian government. "
"Board Wars: The History of Skateboarding in Billings, Montana","Kraft, Duncan; Pavlakis, Dean","Skateboarding and boundaries have never mixed well. Unlike conventional sports, which are confined to a field or court, Skateboarding can be found anywhere their four wheels can take them. Once Skateboarding made its way to Billings, Montana, the city had to ask the question so many other communities were trying to solve: what do we do about the growth of Skateboarding? The exploration involved in Skateboarding often leads those looking to push their limits to city streets or private property. As Skateboarding grew so did the concerns of parents, public officials, and property owners. The culture war of Skateboarding was centered on how to handle the street Skateboarders who became prevalent after the Dark Age of Skateboarding in the 1980s, and the Billings city council decided the solution would be the construction of a skatepark. By utilizing interviews and other primary sources, the evolution of the conflict between Skateboarding culture and mainstream culture is brought to light. Skateboarding caused a culture war in Billings, Montana that the construction of the Downtown Skatepark in 2004 resolved only in the eyes of public officials and law enforcement but not for Skateboarders who still encounter social alienation and negative stereotypes in the schools and community.

Providentialist Theology as a Justification for Slavery in the Civil War Era,"Gold, Greyson; Pavlakis, Dean; Dean","My research examines providentialist theology and its relation to slavery in sermons from Southern pastors in the Antebellum and Reconstruction eras. Providential justifications for slavery generally took three forms: first, the Hamitic hypothesis and Genesis arguments; second, evangelism arguments––that God ordained slavery for the evangelization of Africans; and third, mutual prosperity arguments––that God ordained slavery for the prosperity and progress of the South and the material benefit of Africans. My research specifically examines the third: Providential prosperity arguments for slavery from before and after the war and how these interpretations provided additional justification for racism amongst Southern Christians. I argue that many Southern ministers and theologians in the Antebellum and Reconstruction eras used Providential prosperity arguments to encourage and maintain a white-dominated social hierarchy. "

St. Peters Hospital PAR Levels Analysis,"Miller, Hayden; Baliel, Jeanette; Fiocchi, John; Schweyen, Courtney; Paldi, Brock; Dimian, Adel","Saint Peter’s Health (S.P.H.) currently has deficient supply standardization of Periodic Automatic Replenishment (P.A.R.) levels in their nursing units. This will be executed by analyzing waste levels, improving inventory tracking, and re-evaluate the current processing system to reduce the excess costs. Their current systems dealing with supply levels are negatively impacting their finances. We will be using a D.M.A.I.C.(Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) approach with process designing tools to make data-driven business decisions. The focus of this project is to find the correct P.A.R. level and processing for the nurses at Saint Peter’s Hospital by creating a process.This process will make it easier for hospital staff in terms of gathering necessary supplies for patient care and determining charged versus non-charged supplies. The end goal will result in positive annual savings to better support the staff and secondarily their patient. "

Stress Levels in Premature Infants During Bathing,"Karbowicz, Sonia; Plummer, McKenzie; Skogen, Halee; Hogue, Meagan","Premature infants are a high risk population that should be given every possible accommodation to promote safe growth and healing. Bathing is a critical aspect of care because it prevents infection and promotes recovery. Bathing can be a stressful time for infants due to the unfamiliar sensations, temperature, and separation from their caregiver. Providing a calming experience for the infant may help reduce complications that result from high stress levels. Premature infants are born before the 37th week of pregnancy (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2022). Premature babies are at higher risk than term infants for serious disease, disability, and death (CDC, 2022). Routine bathing lowers the incidence rate of potential complications and was traditionally done as a tub bath or sponge bath. A tub bath consists of pouring water over the neonate when they are placed in a tub (Paran et al. 2016), while a sponge bath consists of wiping the infant with a wet sponge or towel (Peacehealth, 2022). Crying time indicates the level of discomfort and stress the infant is experiencing. The purpose of this evidence-based brief is to examine different bathing practices for premature infants and how it impacts their crying time after bathing. After this examination, some light can be shed on which bathing practice is the most calming for the infant. Nurses can utilize this information within their practice to provide lower stress experiences for premature infants, which can improve their care outcomes. "
Breastfeeding and Postpartum Depression,"Sondag, Emily; Dickerson, Hailey; Gasser, MacKenzie; Hogue, Meagan","Postpartum depression (PPD) is a serious medical diagnosis that affects many aspects of family-centered care and the health of the postpartum mother. It is a mood disorder that occurs after childbirth that goes unresolved for more than one to two weeks (Taber’s Medical Dictionary, 2021). Those with PPD can affect the outcomes for their newborn babies, their family dynamic, and their own mental health. Postpartum mothers include women who have given birth to a newborn child. They are faced with the option of breastfeeding their child as a main form of nutrition over using formula exclusively or as supplementation, in addition to breastfeeding. When these postpartum mothers make this decision, the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) can be used to determine their severity of postpartum depression if it is present. According to the Center of Perinatal Excellence, EPDS is a screening tool that identifies a mother’s risk for PPD (2023). The purpose of this evidence-based brief is to examine the EPDS scores between mothers who chose to breastfeed and mothers who do not choose to breastfeed. The outcome of this brief synopsis may shed light on potential education that nurses can give to mothers based on their EPDS scores. Nurses or other healthcare providers can use this information to determine the effects of breastfeeding on EPDS scores. Knowing these scores and what effects them can provide context for care and education for nurses who provide patient care. "
Study on Patient Outcomes Related to the Use of Ultrasound Guided Peripheral Intravenous Device Access Compared to Insertion Without,"McGreevey, Mattie; Ripley, Sabrina; Sobolewski, Lorenzo; Hogue, Meagan","Peripheral intravenous catheter (PIVC) placement failure rates are staggeringly high and have a first-time success rate of only 65 to 86% (Frank, 2023). Placing a PIVC unsuccessfully can lead to a variety of complications. This includes infiltration of the vein, unnecessary pain for the patient, and reduction of the number of viable veins for future PIVC placement. The results of ineffectively placing an PIVC can also increase the number of central line intravenous devices placed. This is an issue because central line devices have higher rates of complications. Preventing the use of central line intravenous devices except when they are necessary is vital for best practice, and makes correctly placing PIV catheters an essential skill for nurses. A PIVC is a single-lumen catheter placed into a vein typically in an extremity with the assistance of a needle (The Royal Children’s Hospital Melbourne., n.d.). They allow for direct access to the bloodstream enabling quick administration of medication, fluids, and blood. PIV catheters are an essential tool in many healthcare settings, and placing them is a foundational nursing skill. Ultrasound-guided PIVC placement utilizes an ultrasound machine to visualize the location of veins for IV access (Frank, 2023). The purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to explore the effect of using ultrasound to reduce PIVC failure rates. By normalizing ultrasound-guided peripheral PIVC placement in healthcare settings, the failure rate of placement may be reduced. Nurses can use this information to provide care guided by evidence to improve patient outcomes and satisfaction. "
Needleless Connector Hub Disinfection,"Todd, Anna; Schuver, Chris; Michaelson, Ben; Hogue, Meagan","Infections acquired from the bacterial presence on needleless connector hubs in hospital settings are an ongoing problem in healthcare. They pose a major risk to patients; however, infections can be reduced with better standards of care. Nurses should care about this problem because it is something that nurses can easily prevent in our everyday practice and it has the potential to save lives via simple measures. Needleless connector hubs are defined as vascular access lines which can be used to infuse liquids and medications into the body without the use of a needle, such as peripheral intravenous lines or peripherally inserted central catheters (Rocha et al., 2022). Passive disinfection caps refer to specific caps for needleless connector hubs that incorporate isopropyl alcohol within them to passively disinfect the hubs when installed (Casey et al., 2018). The purpose of this evidence-based review is to examine the effects of different types of disinfecting methods on the development of vascular access-related infections, as well as recommend updates in practice according to the findings. Nurses and other healthcare providers can use this information to implement best practices in an effort to reduce the development of vascular-related infections. "
Using Chlorhexidine Gluconate Bathing to Decrease Central-Line Associated Blood Stream Infections,"Smith, Abigail; Polk, Crisha; Winslow, Allison; Hogue, Meagan","Central venous catheters are associated with central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI). According to Reynolds et al. (2021), these preventable cases of CLABSI result in 28,000 deaths annually and cost the U.S. healthcare system an additional $2.3 billion. For the purpose of this review, CLABSI is defined as an infection of the bloodstream resulting from the introduction of microbial flora through central venous catheters (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019). Chlorhexidine gluconate decreases microbial flora and prevents infection risk as an antiseptic agent (Tacconelli et al., 2017). The purpose of this Evidence-Based practice review is to examine the efficacy of daily chlorhexidine gluconate-based hygiene practices on rates of CLABSI in critical care patients. The outcome of this review may provide evidence to support potential changes to healthcare practices regarding antiseptic hygiene in critical care settings. Nurses or other healthcare providers can use this information to implement infection control and prevention into their daily practice to decrease CLABSI rates among their patients. Decreasing the rates of CLABSI infections is important because central lines provide direct access to the patient’s bloodstream, allowing infectious processes to occur faster than other modes of disease transmission "
Patient-controlled Analgesia Compared to Nurse Administered Analgesia,"Sullivan, Sophia; Riordan, Tess; Beveridge, Gabrielle; Hogue, Meagan","In an in-patient care setting, patients rely on their nurses to administer analgesics to manage their pain. When considering the use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), the patient is given the control to manage their own pain independently. Healthcare providers should value the ability to give their patients the autonomy to manage their own pain. Patient-controlled analgesia involves a computerized pump that is attached to the patient's intravenous line or connects to a wristband. This machine allows the patient to release pain medicine either intravenously or as pills by pressing a handheld button (Johns Hopkins Medicine, 2020). Research supports the use that PCA lowers pain scores in hospitalized patients compared to nurse-administered analgesics (Pizzi et al., 2020). Studies have shown that nearly 70% of hospitalized patients experience some amount of pain which makes managing pain a priority for the nurse (Wu et al., 2020). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to monitor patients' pain scores when their analgesic medication is administered by the nurse or by a PCA. The outcome of this brief is to examine the best nursing practice for pain medication administration during hospitalization. The end results of this research may benefit nurses or other healthcare providers to implement the best practice when it comes to managing each patient’s pain. "
"The Effect of Music Therapy Compared to Cholinesterase Inhibitor drugs in the Cognition, Symptoms, and ADLs of Those Diagnosed with Alzheimer’s Disease","Bolin, Morgan; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature that explores music therapy as an alternative or integrated treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. Methods: Articles were found through two research databases, PubMed and CINAHL. They were then screened for information regarding music therapy and cholinesterase inhibitors as a treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. The interventions included song listening, lyric reading, and singing for the alternative therapies, and donepezil and memantine, two commonly used cholinesterase inhibitor drugs used to treat Alzheimer’s disease. Results: While the results were mixed, there was sufficient evidence in support of both music therapy and cholinesterase inhibitors as effective and admissible treatments for Alzheimer’s Disease. Conclusion: Both interventions mentioned in this review produced good evidence to suggest that, whether acting alone or in combination, they could be effective treatment options for Alzheimer’s disease. Music therapy combined with pharmaceutical treatments should be researched more to determine the best option of treatment for those who have Alzheimer’s disease. "
"Effectiveness of Cryotherapy for Delayed-Onset Muscle Soreness, a Systematic Review","Liedle, Liang; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature regarding the effectiveness of cryotherapy treatments on Delayed-onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS) Methods: Literature was collected through CINHAL and PubMed and analyzed for the effectiveness of cryotherapy treatments on DOMS. The interventions included were whole-body cryotherapy (WBC), partial-body cryotherapy (PBC), and cold-water immersion (CWI). Results: The literature showed inconclusive results on the effectiveness of cryotherapy on DOMS. Cryotherapy was shown to be effective in reducing DOMS, compared to no treatment. However, the difference between the various interventions in decreasing muscle soreness was minimal. Conclusions: Cryotherapy has shown some positive results for DOMS, compared to no treatment. Due to cryotherapy being frequently used in athletics, the interventions reviewed in this literature need additional research to establish optimal protocols for DOMS recovery. "

Offer Me Egyptian Delights: An Exploration of Cultural Identity and Gender Performance in Antony and Cleopatra,"Williams, Nicole; Gupta, Soumitree","While it is not one of Shakespeare’s most popular plays, Antony and Cleopatra offers perhaps the greatest deal of insight into the rigid structures of Roman masculinity by juxtaposing this ideology with the fluidity of gender expression presented in Shakespeare’s imagining of Egypt. The play is rich with critical potential, offering countless insights into the structures of gender, cultural identity, and politics to such an extent that the play itself defies any attempts to form a stable reading. Antony struggles to reestablish his identity as a typical, virtuous Roman male, yet also struggles to embrace his relationship with Cleopatra and the fluidity of gender roles within their relationship. Cleopatra herself vacillates between mirroring Antony’s masculinity and embodying a highly feminine archetype, rendering a stable interpretation nearly impossible through her highly fluid performance. In this presentation, I plan to explore the ways in which the performance of gender connects to the titular lovers on an individual scale, as well as the overall political and social dynamic of Rome and Egypt. "
Fighting Fire with Fire: Examining the Decolonial Feminist Politics of Captivity and Resistance in Wide Sargasso Sea,"Williams, Nicole; Gupta, Soumitree","I examine Jean Rhys’ novel Wide Sargasso Sea (1966) to argue that a literary work cannot be considered “resistance literature” (Barbara Harlow) if it does not critique the larger forces of racism and patriarchy that support the colonial structure. Simply setting a literary work within the context of colonialism, even criticizing the colonial structure, does not necessarily make it a decolonial project. While Rhys writes a novel that takes place in colonial Caribbean society, it only becomes resistance literature when she delves into the implications of the colonial system for the lives of the characters, and their resistance towards it. The two major female characters in the novel, Christophine and Antoinette, exist within a system that seeks to bind them, and it is through Rhys’s depiction of their struggles that we see her novel transform into a critique of the colonial structure. I examine the ways that Antoinette plays into her own captivity, and the means by which she eventually frees herself of it, as well as the ways that Christophine exemplifies her own form of individual freedom despite her status as a former slave.

"King of the Island: Caliban, Colonization, and Reclamation of Identity","Hackl, Julia; Gupta, Soumitree","Abstract: In Shakespeare’s play The Tempest, Caliban was never intended to be a central protagonist. As the enraged, rebellious, and brutish slave, railing against his master and the very island which once belonged to him, Caliban was a tool to be utilized by Prospero, and a joke for the audience to laugh at. Aimé Césaire — a prominent anti-colonial poet, activist, and co-founder of the “Négritude movement” — saw more potential in Caliban. His play A Tempest — an anti-colonial revision of Shakepeare’s play — celebrates Caliban as a hero and explores his character in a sympathetic manner. Césaire asks the audience to see Caliban’s name as something that he was not born with, but something forced upon him to further entrench him into his new role as a slave to his colonizers, and in turn, dehumanizing him.

"Reiki Energy Healing with Animals, Does Reiki have the Potential to Strengthen the Human-Animal Bond?; A Review and Comparison of Literature to First-Hand Opinions from Reiki Practitioners","Speck, Shaylee; DeMello, Margo","Reiki energy healing as a complementary medicine is a broad and complex topic; my research specifically covers how the application of Reiki to aid in the healing of animals might have the potential to strengthen the human-animal bond. In an inductive, qualitative, and phenomenological manner, I have explored the practice of Reiki with animals by examining many testimonials and case studies in order to deduce what healing has taken place, and the potential ethical and welfare issues that could arise. Additionally, I have interviewed a few Reiki practitioners about their practice, opinions, and experiences with Reiki and animals. Various testimonials suggest that the experience of receiving Reiki for both ourselves and our animals only strengthens the already existing bond that we have with them. If it is beneficial, non-manipulative, and essentially harmless to assist individuals and their animals for their mental, emotional, spiritual, and physical healing, then I see no reason for the elimination of this alternative and natural healing modality. Until now, we have not been able to fully comprehend, nor has scientific research been able to conclude, if Reiki can strengthen the bond between humans and animals. My findings suggest that it does. Although Reiki is in part an intangible and immeasurable feeling or emotion, a similar phenomenon happens in how we experience the bond with our animals. The concept of Reiki and the human-animal bond are multidimensionally interconnected and may be uniquely qualified to bring to light. "

"I’m Here to Understand You: The Role of First, Second, and Third-Person Perspectives in Empathy","Breit, Julianna; Glowienka, Edward","Colloquially and academically, empathy has a broad meaning, ranging from mimicking emotions to so-called “mind-reading.” In an attempt to unify different philosophical, psychological, and neuroscientific approaches, Lou Agosta organized empathy literature into four different dimensions, with each dimension marking a stage of the empathetic process. He calls these dimensions empathetic receptivity, empathetic understanding, empathetic interpretation, and empathetic response. While Agosta richly explains three dimensions of the multidimensional framework, he leaves empathetic response rather undeveloped. This thesis draws on philosophical and neuroscientific research to address this gap. Emphasizing how to evaluate personal roles in empathetic settings, I propose a revised model for understanding empathy's mechanism and consider its implications for friendship and therapy. Ultimately, this thesis aims to provide helpful language for describing the empathetic process in hopes of reducing misunderstandings, emotional contagion, and compassion fatigue. "
Going Full Circle: How to Implement Circular Economy,"Rodriguez, Javier; Glowienka, Edward","In the current situation of substantial climate change that has the potential to impact our lives in the future, this presentation will address fundamental flaws of capitalism that have led us to ignore or negate these changes by focusing on financial metrics instead of sustainability metrics. A new model of Circular Economy is proposed, one in which the materials that are now what constitute waste when a product has no utility anymore are reintroduced into the production process in a systematic manner. Both utilitarian and sentimental objects will be discussed in a potential global approach and implementation of this alternative economic system. The philosophical backup for the ideas will come from John Nash’s works on Game Theory and the works of Marx, Locke, Hobbes and Rawls among other possible philosophers and ethicists. "

Frank Lloyd Wright's Rejection of Modern Architecture,"Clark, Brady; Pavlakis, Dean","Frank Lloyd Wright is perhaps one of the most influential and well-known modern architects. Influential is certainly a justified description of Wright, yet modern is contentious. This is best shown in Wright’s utopia, the “Broadacre Project,” as he looks to create a society where the buildings reflect the natural landscape around it as well as the individual owner of the house. This evidence, as well as an exploration of the floor plans and designs of Wright, reveal that Wright might have been more opposed to the values of modern architecture, namely a rejection of uniformity and pure utility. Instead, Wright looked to make individualized spaces for his clients, combine utility with comfort, and base his designs on nature rather than the creations of humans. "
Convolution: Reading US License Plates from Multiple Perspectives,"Bathon, Jaden; Wendt, Ted","Images with characters and numbers can be too far away for the human eye to read. This research attempts to take blurry photos of license plates and give the plate number and the associated state. Last semester we were in a car driving from Kalispell back to Helena and there was a white truck swerving on the road. Because of how fast we were traveling, none of the people in the car could read the plate number to report the truck. Some of us tried to take a zoomed-in picture to try to make the plate easier to read. This made us wish there was an application that could tell us the plate number and the state. This led to training a neural network on multiple images of state license plates. These images are randomly warped and blurred to imitate multiple perspectives. This network would be a convolutional neural network that took the large pictures of the license plate and condensed them into smaller images that are the essence of a license plate. Using this condensed data the neural network can predict the plate number and the state the plate is from. To measure how accurate this model is the images will be split into a training set and a testing set the testing set will never be seen by the model. The model’s accuracy will be determined by how well it predicts the unseen data. "

Epidural Use Compared to Alternative Techniques for Labor Pain,"Trautmann, Mark; Lewis, Melissa","Annually in the United States there are about 3.5 million recorded childbirths that occur in a hospital setting. Of those, 2.5 million mothers choose epidural anesthesia as their form of pain management (Osterman et al., 2021). Epidural analgesia is a procedure done be the anesthesiology department in which medication is injected into the spinal canal to essentially numb the mother from the waist down (American Society of Anesthesiology, n.d). Although epidurals generally provide significant pain relief for laboring mothers, other less invasive techniques for pain control have been shown to be just as effective. Epidurals are associated with certain increased risks such as prolonged labor, increased risk for cesarean section, increased chance of postpartum hemorrhage, and trauma to the baby (Birth Injury Help Center, 2023). Reasons mothers choose epidurals for pain management can vary, however there is a lack of education regarding the efficacy of alternative pain management and their ability to provide pain relief. The purpose of this evidence-based review is to examine to efficacy of epidural analgesia versus alternative pain management techniques. Nurses and healthcare providers who provide education to mothers and families about these techniques when indicated, can reduce the risk of complications of labor and the cost to both the patient and the hospital can also be reduced. "
Early Integration of Palliative Care and Quality of Life in Advanced-Stage Cancer,"Younkin, Abigail; Lewis, Melissa","Despite advances in research, cancer continues to be a global health concern. In 2020 it was estimated that 1.8 million new cases of cancer would be diagnosed, with more than 600,000 predicted to succumb to the disease (National Cancer Institute, 2023). Cancer care treatment options can be complicated by an advanced-stage diagnosis. Quality of Life (QoL) is an important factor when considering treatment options. QoL is defined as the enjoyment of life and how it relates to an individual sense of well-being and the ability to carry out activities of daily living. One treatment option for patients with advanced cancer diagnoses is early palliative care (EPC) which prioritizes the management of pain and symptoms, setting goals of care, providing psychosocial support, and honoring the individual’s unique ideals related to their disease. Comparatively, standard oncological care (SOC) is another treatment option that can be pursued which generally consists of therapies aimed at targeting cancer cells with the help of a care team. The purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to determine the QoL outcomes for advanced-stage cancer patients, specifically comparing QoL ratings for those seeking EPC interventions with those who seek SOC treatments. This research aims to provide information regarding the QoL outcomes between the two groups to provide insight for providers of patients with advanced-stage diagnoses. This is also of interest to the nursing community, as nurses are often at the forefront of providing treatments to cancer patients, especially therapies and advocacy related to QoL. "
Continuous Labor Support and Cesarean Section Incidence,"Stanchfield, Kayla; Lewis, Melissa","In 2022, the rate of cesarean section delivery in the United States was 32.1% of all births in the country (Osterman, 2022). A cesarean section is an incision made in a mother’s abdomen and uterus to deliver a baby when it is determined to be safer than a vaginal birth (Johns Hopkins, 2023). Cesarean sections are associated with increased risks to maternal fertility, infection, hemorrhage, thromboembolic events, and hysterectomy (Keag, 2018). The Association of Women’s Health, Obstetric and Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN) (2021) recommends that there be a staffing ratio in perinatal units of one nurse to one laboring mother. AWHONN recommends this based as many complications may arise that can threaten the livelihood of mother and baby; adequate staffing is required to recognize early signs of complications, as well as to provide emotional support to laboring mothers. Methods to reduce stress including continuous support by a clinician, a positive birth environment, and social support have been shown to reduce labor stress and support endogenous oxytocin release, promoting a physiologic birth (Walter et al., 2021). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to determine if there is an association between continuous support by a healthcare professional during the labor process and the risk of cesarean section. It is important to understand how continuous care could influence cesarean section risk to avoid an unnecessary invasive procedure that can have negative outcomes for mother and baby, and how nurses can fit into the role of one-to-one support providers.

Delayed Cord Clamping in Newborns and Anemia,"Robb, Alexus; Lewis, Melissa","Anemia in infancy can lead to an array of issues with growth and development. According to Tiruneh et al. (2020), the prevalence of anemia in the newborn population is 25% worldwide. Anemia is caused by a lack of oxygen carrying red blood cells, which starves the body of oxygen. Prolonged anemia during development has been linked to various alterations in physical maturation and neurodevelopment. Researchers have hypothesized that umbilical cord clamping methods during delivery can play a critical role in developing anemia in infants. Furthermore, researchers offer ideas about the benefits of increased hemoglobin, hematocrit, and iron related to the use of delayed cord clamping (DCC) can last up to 6 months for term infants, as well as additional benefits for preterm infants. DCC involves clamping the umbilical cord after at least 60 seconds but up to 10 minutes of life. In comparison, early cord clamping (ECC) is characterized by the provider clamping the umbilical cord immediately upon delivery. Based on this information, the purpose of this Evidence Based Practice review is to determine the efficacy of DCC versus ECC in reducing anemia in infants. This simple and cost-effective measure is thought to significantly reduce the risk of anemia in infancy, and its following complications. Although the benefits of DCC versus ECC have been substantiated, the practice has not been fully adopted. Nurses will be able to help educate and spread awareness of this simple practice with expectant parents and practitioners alike. "
Breastfeeding and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome,"Lovingood, Julia; Lewis, Melissa","An estimated three million people in the US are currently or have previously suffered from opioid use disorder (Azadfard et al., 2022), and pregnant women are not immune to this misuse problem. Nearly 7% of women in 2019 self-reported using prescription opioids during pregnancy (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). This has led to an uptick in the incidence of neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), which results following the cessation of exposure to substance(s) to which the fetus was exposed in-utero (Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, 2005). In 2018, approximately seven newborns were diagnosed with NAS for every 1,000 hospital births (Hirai et al., 2021). Neonates with NAS showed an increased length of hospitalization, which is associated with increased healthcare costs and poor bonding between the mother and neonate (Lean et al., 2018). Breastfeeding has the ability to strengthen bonding, and oxytocin released during lactation helps stimulate emotional connection between the mother and child (World Health Organization, 2009). The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine have developed breastfeeding recommendations in the NAS population. Despite these recommendations, successful breastfeeding in the NAS population is still quite low. The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice brief is to review literature to determine if breastfeeding has an effect on length of hospital stay in neonates with NAS. Ultimately, the aim of this brief is to elucidate findings on this matter and help generate recommendations for best practice for nurses caring for newborns with NAS. "
Pregnancy Outcomes Related to COVID-19,"Rietmann, Annika; Lewis, Melissa","Starting in late 2019, COVID-19 began to spread rapidly through the United States. This stretched our healthcare system thin and healthcare providers were left with questions on how to treat vulnerable populations, including pregnant women. COVID-19 is primarily a respiratory illness but has shown to negatively affect other body systems as well (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, (2022b). From January 2020 to July 2022, a total of 225,656 pregnant women had COVID-19 during gestation. The U.S Government and Accountability office (2022) reported that 25% of maternal deaths were due to COVID-19 in 2020 and 2021. This Evidenced-Based Practice (EBP) review is comparing maternal complications of women who were infected with COVID-19 while pregnant to women who did not get the illness during gestation. Complications of pregnancy include preterm labor, miscarriage, postpartum hemorrhage, sepsis, and even death. EBP allows healthcare providers to give top quality care. If nurses understand what complications women are at risk for if infected with COVID-19, labor and delivery teams may be better prepared for complications that may arise. "
Perineal Massage and Reduction in Perineal Trauma During Vaginal Delivery,"Booth, Jane; Hogue, Meagan; Lewis, Melissa","During vaginal childbirth, the region between the vulva and the anus, also known as the perineum, is susceptible to trauma due to stretching and tearing as the baby's head emerges, often resulting in lacerations, especially for nulliparous women, women who’ve never given birth before. Furthermore, episiotomies are procedures that are often performed during vaginal childbirth in which a surgical incision is made from the vagina into the perineum to attempt to prevent tissue rupture and help with difficult or fast births. Unfortunately, these often result in further tearing, more blood loss, infection, and postpartum pain (Ramar and Grimes, 2022). As for incidence, vaginal deliveries in the United States totaled 2,486,856 in 2021 (CDC, 2023). Over 85% of women that deliver vaginally experience some degree of laceration and/or episiotomy, increasing to 90.4% for those that are nulliparous or primiparous (Smith, 2013). Perineal massage (PM) is an intervention that can be performed during pregnancy to prepare the perineum for childbirth by stretching and softening the tissues in the perineum, making it more flexible and reducing the risk of trauma during delivery (Ramar and Grimes, 2022). The purpose of this evidenced based practice review is to examine the effects of PM compared to no PM on nulliparous/primiparous women delivering vaginally. Nurses or other healthcare providers can use this information to see if perineal massage is a beneficial intervention that can improve health outcomes in women during childbirth and reduce the incidence of perineal trauma.

The Effect of Music Therapy on Preterm Infants’ Neurodevelopment,"Kemp, Phoebe; Hynson, Kira; Bubb, Nicholas; Hogue, Meagan","Preterm infants can suffer a decrease in neurodevelopment because of the lack of time they have in the womb to develop fully. A preterm infant is defined as any baby born before 37 weeks of gestation (World Health Organization, 2022). Compared to an infant born at full term, preterm infants can suffer from an increased risk of mortality and neurological deficits that extend throughout their lives (Woythaler, 2019). According to the CDC (n.d.), in the United States one out of every 10 babies are born preterm and thus the issue of decreased neurodevelopment is prominent. One key area of development that is diminished, due to preterm birth, is in the brain. Neurodevelopment is the process in which neurons and synaptic connections form to construct an individual’s ability to learn, focus, make decisions, and socialize, etc. (Oliphant & Lu, 2020). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to examine the effect that music therapy has on the neurodevelopment of preterm infants. Nurses or other healthcare providers can use this information as an intervention to promote and improve the neurodevelopment and functional brain activity of preterm infants during their stay in the hospital and as a recommendation to parents beyond their hospital stay. "
Aromatherapy Effects on Postoperative Pain Management,"Mork, Hannah; Anderson, Echo; Hill, Elias; Hogue, Meagan","A large part of postoperative care revolves around pain management for the patient. Pain is a subjective experience, meaning it varies greatly from patient to patient. This requires nurses to have various methods of pain control available to meet the diverse needs of patients. Inadequate pain management in the postoperative phase of care can lead to slower recovery, adverse physiologic and psychologic effects, trauma for the patient, and can lead to worse patient outcomes overall (Horn & Kramer, 2022). Whether it is through pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic methods, all patients have a right to adequate pain management. Complementary therapies are a way for patients to ease their pain. The purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to examine how the use of aromatherapy as an adjunct to pharmacological pain management will affect pain control in postoperative patients. For the purpose of this research, aromatherapy is defined as the therapeutic use of essential oils distilled from plants (Venes, 2021). The outcome of this review will provide healthcare providers with information regarding the efficacy of alternative pain management in order to explore methods to provide patients with better pain control. In turn, this will allow nurses and other healthcare providers to better facilitate recovery for patients in the postoperative period and improve their postoperative outcomes. "
Childhood Trauma and Major Depression in Adulthood,"George, Sophie; Hogue, Meagan; Lewis, Melissa","Childhood trauma and major depression in adulthood are pressing issues in the United States today. High adverse childhood experiences scores (ACEs) are prevalent – one in six adults in the United States reported experiencing four or more types of ACEs in their lifetime when surveyed in November 2019 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2019). Depression is also a widespread and common disorder – the 2020 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that 21 million adults 18 or older in the United States had at least one major depressive episode in 2020, representing 8.4% of adults in the United States (National Institute of Mental Health, 2022b). The ACEs Questionnaire is a 10-question scoring system that measures trauma before the age of 18 – it asks questions related to emotional or sexual abuse, substance use within the home, death, divorce, a parent who is incarcerated, and more. The Childhood Maltreatment (CM) scoring system operates similarly, giving a score of 0 to 20, with higher scores reflecting greater severity of maltreatment. Due to the high incidence of both childhood trauma and major depression in adults, it is relevant to ask if the two are positively correlated; the purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to better understand the relationship between childhood trauma and major depression in adulthood. Nurses and other healthcare professionals can use this information to provide trauma-informed care to psychiatric patients and any patient with coexisting psychiatric conditions. "
Music Therapy and Pain Relief in the Stages of Labor,"Kohler, Sophia; Hert, Mikayla; Bourekis, Maria; Hogue, Meagan","The intrapartum period is said to be one of the most painful experiences a woman may have and is highly individualized. Pain control is a major concern for the healthcare team, and there are several studies for pain management including nonpharmacological methods such as music therapy. According to Buglione et al. (2020), the use of epidural anesthesia is more effective in reducing pain during labor but increases the risk of an operative vaginal delivery or cesarean section. Therefore, an approach such as music therapy for pain relief is a goal for nurses (Buglione et al., 2020). The music therapy discussed within these studies included listening to an array of musical audio during the birthing process. The intrapartum period as it relates to this systematic review is defined as “occurring or provided during the act of birth” (Merriam-Webster, n.d., para. 1). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice project is to examine the relationship between music therapy and pain during the intrapartum period. Several studies have shown that music therapy is effective in reducing painful stimuli and anxiety levels, both psychologically and physiologically. According to McCaffery et al. (2020), fifteen studies reported evidential results that support the hypothesis that music reduces pain during and after labor (McCaffery et al., 2020). By implementing this simple, non-pharmacological intervention, healthcare providers can use this information to reduce pain ratings during the stages of labor. "
"Mindfulness, Nursing Practice, & Pain","Chan, Mitchell; Brosnan, Maria; Lewis, Melissa","Pain control is a significant public health concern that permeates through all demographics & diseases. Almost two-thirds of primary providers’ patients report pain, while a third of emergency department visits are due to pain (Hoffman & Sullivan, 2020). There are a deluge of therapies to slake the bite of pain, both pharmacological & nonpharmacological in nature. Psychotherapy is a subdivision of the nonpharmacological adjuncts to pain control, including a growing body of research on mindfulness-based interventions (MBI). These interventions drove the creation of the research question featured in this evidence-based practice brief: For patients experiencing pain, do mindfulness-based interventions when compared to non-mindfulness interventions reduce a patient’s reported pain? Mindfulness is described by Bishop et al. (2004) as a focus on present experiences to increase one’s awareness of their thoughts & sensations, in addition to an open-minded predisposition towards the present experience. MBIs in the context of this review are self-administered interventions that can be done independently, using pre-recorded audio to guide mindfulness practice or an application with exercises in mindfulness. This brief quantified pain using a numerical scale, although the authors often used additional inventories to measure psychological health. The purpose of this evidenced-based practice brief is to investigate the potential of MBIs in pain control. Nurses & their team can utilize this category of interventions to promote patient choice & involvement in the management of pain, in addition to potentially reducing their stress. MBIs offer an additional noninvasive therapy to patients, which can be titrated by them. "
End-of-Life Care: Does Knowledge of Care impact Quality of Care,"Snow, Kathleen; Lewis, Melissa; Brosnan, Maria","End of Life Care (EOLC) is a common need among elderly and terminally ill patients. Currently, one in 10 patients in the ICU (Intensive Care Unit) are elderly (over age 65-years-old), and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases or illnesses. Half of these individuals will die in a hospital or long-term care setting. Both populations are expected to grow at exponential rates over the next 30 years. Coupled with nursing shortages currently leaving ICU ratios of 1:4, the quality of EOLC is in jeopardy of suffering. ICU nurses provide EOLC regularly. However, a lack of knowledge of what quality EOLC is can have negative repercussions on the patient and families. This means that instead of approaching a patient as a list of terminal illnesses, they can approach them as a human experiencing the end of their life. This is a pivotal moment for someone passing on, as well as for their family dealing with this loss. The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to determine if a knowledge of EOLC has an impact on the quality of EOLC given by ICU nurses. It is thought that quality EOLC can come only with experience. However, continuing education can provide caregivers with necessary skills to assist EOLC patients in the ICU. Nurses and other healthcare providers can use this information to include advanced directives, communicate openly with patients and families, and keep care team members on the same page, limiting obstacles to quality EOLC.

Estimating the Temperature of Solar Flares from X-Ray Emission Data,"Johnson, Max; Cline, Kelly","Solar flares are large eruptions of electromagnetic radiation caused primarily by instabilities in the sun’s magnetic field. They are an area of significant interest in solar physics as they provide information about the composition and magnetic nature of the sun. The influx of radiation from particularly powerful flares can also cause radio blackouts on Earth, further increasing their relevance. Solar flares emit a wide range of electromagnetic wavelengths, including significant x-ray radiation. The NASA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) network continuously collects measurements of the sun’s x-ray emissions, including during solar flares, via a pair of instruments. These two instruments are known as the “short” and “long” channels of the GOES X-Ray Sensors (XRS). The internal specifications of these instruments along with a solar flare model can be used to calculate a numerical value for the response of each instrument as a function of temperature of the solar flare. The short and long channels of GOES XRS demonstrate consistently different but comparable responses for a given range of temperatures. By comparing the ratio of the responses to each other, it can be shown that given ratios of responses correspond to temperatures of solar flares. "
Effects of COVID-19 on Student Achievement,"Ramirez, Rosalina; Boese, Courtney; Arnold, Mekenzie; Edwards, Trinity; Gilboy, Kathy","Our research project is a meta-analysis of findings throughout the world on the effects of COVID-19 and distance learning for students of all ages. Effect categories included, but were not limited to, self-efficacy, social connectedness, mental health, and academic achievement. Many of these studies surveyed students’ first-hand experiences of learning before the pandemic, during the lockdown, and after distance and hybrid learning was implemented. Students surveyed were of all ages, from preschool through college. The vast majority of the experiences reported were overwhelmingly negative in all categories. As students began to move back into in-person learning the negative effects they felt on their productivity and motivation continued. This led us to conclude that the effects of COVID-19 made a significant impact on students socially, mentally, and educationally. These effects need to be recognized by teachers and administrators, as they will impact classrooms worldwide for the foreseeable future. "
How to Incorporate the History of Mathematics into Secondary Classrooms,"Ryan, Rachel; Fasteen, Jodi","Students learn mathematics better when they are excited about the subject and engaged during class time. One way to promote student engagement in math classes is to teach topics in the context they were discovered. In this presentation, several topics included in middle school and high school math curriculum will be shared in their historical context. Topics include the Pythagorean brotherhood, the controversy of the number zero and irrational numbers, how algebra originated, the debates on calculus, China and India’s contributions, and how symbols were developed to represent numbers.

Determining Musical Genre,"Bonar, Catherine; Fasteen, Jodi","For decades, artists have been creating new styles of music and different genres based upon different inspirations. Artists are continually asked “who has inspired you?” or “what has influenced your music?” Using a dataset filled with this information about different artists and their influences, we have worked to create a predictive model that determines just how closely correlated a follower’s music is to their muse. We also used additional information about specific songs from various artists to help in our process. From keys to tempo, all songs have numeric and categorical ways that they can be quantified. Using the different numeric characteristics of music, we have found a way to predict what genre a song will fall into. Using these predictions, and understanding the numeric values of different genres, we can observe how current artists have either stayed or strayed from their influencers. "
Radium Ranch Septic Design for Subdivision Review,"Linn, Maya; Fischer, Gary","This project focuses on the design of on-site water and wastewater systems for a small subdivision located in Butte Silver Bow County. The 122 acre property will be split into five parcels, each of different sizes and characteristics. Our team was tasked with complying with several regulatory standards and agencies while also working to satisfy the clients needs in terms of property layout. The overall goal of this project is to design for a septic system on each of the five subdivided lots so that the client can receive a permit compliant with the subdivision review process. In our presentation, we will discuss the level of septic treatment needed at each site, the layout and design of septic tanks and their drain fields, along with a final engineering cost estimate for the project.

East Helena Wastewater Nitrogen Study,"Burgess, Matthew; Sassano, Colin; Powell, Stephen; Fischer, Gary","The City of East Helena is experiencing rapid growth within the City limits. As the population continues to grow, the Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) will see an increased load. All wastewater plants around the state are given a discharge permit that depends on a variety of factors including where the treated effluent is discharged. In East Helena’s case, they are discharging into a small stream called Prickly Pear Creek. Smaller streams require more treatment because there is less dilution capacity. While the City has not yet violated their permit, continued growth in the area and increased loads on the plant will require a better treatment process than is currently being utilized. Our goal is to design a solution to improve the treatment efficiency for removing Nitrogen in the East Helena WWTP to prevent Nitrogen levels in Prickly Pear Creek from exceeding the limit. In our presentation, we will describe why we chose to convert the current aeration basin to a Modified Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE) process, the current site conditions, gathered data, design criteria and constraints, environmental and societal impacts, cost estimate, and required permitting. The MLE process will create two separate zones, anoxic and aerobic, to facilitate the removal of nitrogen in the water. "
Investigation into the Predominant Pathway by which Ashwagandha Increases Testosterone,"Held, Benjamin; Romney, Kaiden; Sheafor, Brandon","Ashwagandha is an herb native to Asia and Africa that has received much attention in recent years for its “heal-all” abilities. Advocates of the root claim that it relieves stress and anxiety, lowers blood sugar, increases muscle performance, boosts sexual hormones, improves focus and memory, increases heart health, and may even have clinical applications in cancer treatment. Although a fair amount of research has been performed on the effects of ashwagandha, little is known about the mechanism by which it boosts testosterone and subsequently increases muscular performance. The object of this experiment is to determine whether or not luteinizing hormone (LH) is the predominant pathway by which testosterone is increased. Ashwagandha may promote the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus, which in turn promotes the release of LH from the pituitary gland to stimulate testosterone production. To test this, three experimental groups of frogs will be given one of the following treatments: 1.) control (no chemical exposure), 2.) exposure to GnRH, 3.) exposure to ashwagandha extract. At the end of the treatment period, all frogs will be evaluated for LH and testosterone concentrations in plasma and urine. If ashwagandha does increase testosterone primarily through the LH pathway, then the concentration ratio of LH to testosterone should be equivalent between the GnRH treatment group and the ashwagandha treatment group. If an equivalent ratio is not detected, more research will be required to determine by which alternative physiological pathway ashwagandha increases testosterone. "
Investigating the Potential for Antidepressant-Induced Worsening of Depression in the C. elegans Model System,"McEuen, Katherine; Radosevich, Timothy; Sheafor, Brandon","In 2018, over 70.9 million antidepressant items were prescribed, with about 9.5% of adult Americans struggling with some form of depression each year. An effective and widely used class of drugs to combat depression symptoms are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Unfortunately, the most prescribed SSRIs, fluoxetine (under the brand name Prozac), can induce considerable side effects. According to the national library of medicine, 30.4% of patients who take the common SSRI fluoxetine will develop acute worsening of depression (Ungvari et al., 2019). These symptoms may manifest as fatigue, reduced sexual drive, and/or decreased metabolic rate. While research has been performed on worsening depression due to SSRIs in humans, it is unclear whether the cause is psychological or pharmacological due to biases with self-reporting. We will use hermaphroditic Caenorhabditis elegans as a model organism because they have serotonin receptors similar to those found in humans. We will expose C. elegans to fluoxetine and perform several behavioral and physiological tests to assess symptoms of depression. These exams will evaluate heart rate (a general indicator of baseline health), reproductive drive, and responses to stress and external stimuli. Each test was selected from the DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder in humans. If C. elegans develop the aforementioned symptoms, we can conclude fluoxetine intake manifests in physiological reactions. If few to none of the symptoms are present, it would indicate that the depression with fluoxetine is more psychologically than physiologically based. "
Characterizing Microbial Communities among the Berkeley Pit Water Filtration System,"Held, Benjamin; Beck, Ashley","Once called the “richest hill on earth”, the Berkeley Pit copper mine in Butte, Montana is now a deadly Federal Superfund site. A treatment plant was opened in 2019 to purify and polish water from the Pit for reintroduction to local waterways. Once water is treated for toxic and heavy metals, the purified water is introduced into Silver Bow Creek, just below the Pit. Purification efforts have been successful in removing toxic materials, but no research has been done on microbial communities. To investigate microbial diversity, water samples were taken from nine sites in and around Butte including: the Berkeley Pit; the water treatment plant; the purified water introduction site; stream locations up to 10 miles west of Butte. The microbiome of each site was characterized through Nanopore 16S gene sequencing, and community composition was compared across sites. Notable results include a high concentration of Acidobacteria found only in the Berkeley Pit, a Bacteroidetes presence in all sites but the Pit, and an increasing concentration of Proteobacteria with distance from the purified water introduction site. This research presents an initial survey of microbial diversity as an indicator of ecosystem health in our invaluable water sources. "
The Effects of Fun on Executive Functioning,"Bradt, Katie; Kastner, Kaden; Honzel, Nikki","Few studies in neuroscience have studied the effect of “fun” on the brain. Therefore, the current study investigated the connection between fun and executive functioning using EEG recordings. Forty undergraduate students participated in the study. Fifteen participants played jenga with a friend of their choice, rated their level of fun on a scale of one to six, and then underwent a computerized task to measure levels of executive functioning using EEG recordings. Previous studies found that playing games with a friend significantly increases levels of self-perceived fun, compared to completing tasks alone (Reis et al., 2017). To compare the effect of fun, the control group consisted of twenty-five participants. In the control group, participants were asked to complete questionnaires prior to completing the EEG task. The total amount of time completing the study was similar between groups. The EEG data will be segmented to specific neurological components that reflect aspects of cognitive functioning, such as attention and memory. The current data analysis focused on two specific peaks, N2 and P3. The two peaks correspond to conflict detection and response inhibition, respectively (Shi, 2022). Physiologically, anger and excitement can be similar (Schacter, 1964). Previous studies have found reduced N2 and increased P3 responses in individuals that score higher on an anger trait (Liu et al., 2015). Therefore, it is hypothesized that participants in the fun group will have larger P3 and smaller N2 amplitudes compared to the non-fun group (Dierolf et al., 2017; Liu et al., 2015; Xia et al., 2020).

Seasonal Changes to Developing Insecticide Resistance in Mosquito Vector Species in Montana.,"Jones, Amber; Hokit, Grant","Insecticide resistance (IR) in mosquitos is becoming increasingly important to monitor in order to protect the health of humans and other animals. This is necessary for public health because mosquito-borne diseases continue to persist all over the world, despite the efforts to mitigate possible vectors. The development of IR may be why there has been failure with control attempts. The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of several common insecticides including chlorpyrifos, naled, and permethrin on the mechanism of resistance among several species of mosquitoes across Montana. It was hypothesized that mortality rates in mosquitoes exposed to each insecticide would decrease over the eight weeks of experimentation. To test this hypothesis, surveillance sites that were dominated by one species were selected for IR testing. Four bottles were coated with prepared CDC recommended concentrations of each insecticide, while the control bottles were coated in acetone. After the bottles were air-dried for at least 60 minutes, the mosquitoes were introduced using a standard mouth aspirator. The number of mosquitoes were counted upon introduction, and then at specific time increments up to 120 minutes. Each mosquito exposed to insecticides were speciated, and the mortality was calculated. This protocol was repeated over the 8 weeks of the study. The results suggest that there is evidence of developing resistance of the insecticides tested, but further study is needed to determine the pathway of resistance. "
"The Potential for DEM, DEF, or PBO as an Enzymatic Pathway for Resistance to Chlorpyrifos in Aedes vexans","Anselmo, Belle; Hokit, Grant","Mosquito resistance to insecticides is an emerging issue, as increased resistance means less methods of population control. Previous research has shown developing and established resistance in Aedes vexans to the insecticide chlorpyrifos. Mosquitoes can carry many vector-borne diseases such as Zika virus, West Nile virus, and malaria. A key aspect in preventing the transmission of these diseases is using effective insecticides. As insecticide resistance in mosquitoes continues to emerge, understanding the enzymatic pathways behind this resistance is critical. Potential enzymatic pathways could involve the inhibitors diethyl maleate (DEM), S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate (DEF), or piperonyl butoxide (PBO). Mosquitoes were trapped from various collection sites, and CDC bottle bioassay guidelines were followed for exposure of mosquitoes to one of three inhibitors. After this exposure, mosquitos were separated into a control bottle or a bottle coated with chlorpyrifos. The number of dead individuals were counted at regular intervals, and percent mortality was calculated and compared to the established diagnostic time of death for Aedes exposed to chlorpyrifos. It is anticipated that if the activity of a specified enzyme plays a role in resistance, exposure to the respective inhibitor will prevent this enzymatic pathway and mosquitoes will have an increased mortality rate. Simulation analysis will be used to analyze both the impact of exposure to chlorpyrifos and exposure to DEM, DEF, or PBO. If this mathematical analysis reveals a significant impact of inhibitor exposure on mortality rate, further assays could be performed to examine the extent of this pathway across species. "
Spatiotemporal Modeling of Microbial Community Interactions,"Short, Samantha; Beck, Ashley","Bacterial communities are essential to plant growth and development; soil microbes can colonize roots and enter into symbiosis with plants, exchanging nutrients and protecting against pathogens. Relatively little is understood about the mechanisms that shape bacterial communities and govern plant-microbe interactions. Environmental conditions, such as plant hosts, soil nutrient conditions, pH, and temperature, influence species' metabolic responses and resulting interspecies interactions as a function of both space and time. Cooperation or competition between bacterial species is likely affected by both their metabolic capabilities and the heterogeneous micro-niches within plant roots. These interactions are very difficult to dissect experimentally, and modeling provides a great tool to develop hypotheses about interactions. This study investigates the utility of the Computation of Microbial Ecosystems in Time and Space (COMETs) software for spatiotemporal metabolic modeling to predict bacterial metabolic and growth responses in simulated environments for seven key bacteria associated with maize roots.

Characterizing Nitrogen and Aquatic Microbial Communities Across Montana,"Keil-Hoye, Serena; Bold, Katherine; Beck, Ashley","As water is becoming an extremely scarce and precious resource, it is integral to understand the relationship between Montana’s water resources and the effects of nitrogen on water quality. This experiment aims to characterize the relationship between microbial communities and nitrogen levels in natural and man-made water bodies across Central and NorthWest Montana. We expect the higher levels of nitrogen to correlate to more harmful bacteria in the water and for there to be more nitrogen in man-made bodies of water than in natural bodies of water. Water samples were collected during March and October 2022 from eight locations for chemical analysis, and sediment samples were also collected in October for microbial analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from the sediment samples, followed by PCR amplification of the 16S gene and Nanopore sequencing to determine the relative composition of bacterial groups in each sampling location. Nitrate and nitrite levels were determined by Energy Labs (Helena, Montana) and correlated with bacterial community composition. Here we present findings on patterns of microbial communities across Montana water sources in relation to nitrogen levels to address the increased concerns regarding the quality of our water sources.

Investigating the Efficacy of Disinfectants to Minimize Common Bacterial Contamination in Laboratories,"Wald, Elliot; Lepage, June; Beck, Ashley","Maintaining laboratory safety requires an understanding of how to properly disinfect biological contaminations. Carroll College labs often work with common bacterial strains that need proper handling and effective disinfection in the event of contamination. Disinfectants vary in their ability to maintain a clean lab environment. This project compares the effectiveness of Vesphene III-se and bleach to disinfect some of the most common bacteria used in Carroll labs: Bacillus subtillis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The standard concentrations of Vesphene and bleach were tested with contact times of 5, 10, and 20 minutes. Cultures were incubated with the disinfectant, diluted, and plated. The viable bacteria were counted after treatment to determine the effectiveness of the disinfectant. We will present findings on the correlation between contact times and bacterial viability for different disinfectant concentrations. Our results will help update Carroll’s biological contamination protocol, to optimize safety and efficiency in Carroll labs. "
Time Course of Metabolic Shifts in Cartilage Explants Exposed to Short-Term Simulated Microgravity,"Houske, Eden; Chapman, Marrin; Bourekis, Kiki; Hahn, Alyssa","Evidence suggests that abnormal mechanical loading leads to an imbalance in chondrocyte metabolism that results in cartilage degeneration – a hallmark of osteoarthritis (OA). Microgravity exposure in space reduces mechanical loads, potentially leading to increased catabolic activity of chondrocytes and the development of OA. This study aimed to assess how chondrocyte metabolism is altered in response to simulated microgravity (SM) exposure to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for cartilage degeneration in reduced-loading environments. Healthy post-mortem human cartilage explants were exposed to SM for 1 or 4 days using a Rotating Wall Vessel (RWV) bioreactor with the remaining control explants exposed to normal gravitational forces. A subset of the control and SM explants were analyzed for cell viability by staining and measuring relative fluorescence units. Metabolites were extracted from explants and surrounding media and data were generated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Pathways upregulated in response to SM include pyrimidine, amino acid, and sugar metabolism which may be suggestive of extracellular matrix remodeling. Changes in metabolites secreted from explants into the surrounding media mapped to lysine and vitamin E metabolism. These have been previously detected in human synovial fluid from osteoarthritic donors, suggesting that even short-term SM exposure may induce metabolic shifts similar to that of early OA. Notably, this is the first study to map global metabolic changes in cartilage in response to short-term SM exposure to gain insight into the risk of developing OA post-spaceflight. "
Generation of Global Metabolomic Profiles of Normal and ADPKD Renal Epithelial Cells Exposed to Fluid Flow-Induced Shear Stress,"Goulet, Elaina; Ward, Michael; Hahn, Alyssa","Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a hereditary disease that is the 4th leading cause of renal replacement and failure worldwide. The disease has been linked to mutations of polycystins 1 and 2 in primary cilia in renal epithelial cells under fluid flow shear stress. Cellular pathways become altered due to impaired mechanotransduction, ultimately leading to the formation of renal cysts. The goal of this study was to characterize the metabolic response of ADPKD cell lines under fluid flow-induced shear stress in comparison to healthy renal epithelial cells under static controls. ADPKD cell lines (WT 9-7 and WT 9-12) and healthy renal epithelial cell lines (HK-2) were cultured and exposed to either fluid flow or static conditions and metabolites were extracted for LC-MS analysis. ADPKD cell lines exhibited metabolic changes in response to fluid flow-induced shear stress in comparison to healthy renal epithelial cells, suggestive of dysfunctional mechanotransduction. There were also differences between the two ADPKD cell lines, suggestive of cells being affected differently. This study provides a greater understanding of metabolism in ADPKD pathogenesis for the identification of potential drug targets to slow or ameliorate disease. "
Staphylococcus aureus Indicator,"Crichton, Juliette; Breit, Julianna; Chennai, Oviya; Lieberg, Jaedon; Kuga, Kylie; Rowley, John","The long-range objective of this research is to develop a chemical method to detect Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Herein we assess the viability of using the controlled emission and quenching of fluorescent dyes as that chemical detection method. One of the major extracellular proteases produced by S. aureus is the V8 protease which cleaves peptide bonds connected to glutamic acid. When the V8 protease cleaves the dye-quenching glutamic acid from the dye-tagged amino acid chain, the remaining poorly-quenching amino acid will allow the dye to fluoresce, indicating the presence of S. aureus. Preliminary fluorescence quenching of 2’7 dichlorofluorescein (2’7 DCF) was performed using Stern-Volmer analysis to assess the viability of a fluorophore-quencher/peptide compound. Irrespective of pH, the fluorescence of 2’7 DCF was strongly quenched by glutamic acid with a quenching constant of 37.04. The fluorescence of 2’7 DCF was weakly quenched by amino acids alanine, proline, and glycine with quenching constants of 1.24, 1.28, and 1.27 respectively. Using this quenching behavior, we propose the synthesis of a fluorophore-quencher/peptide compound in which the 2’7 DCF is covalently bound to a weakly quenching peptide chain containing glutamic acid.

Activation Energy of Enzyme and Non-Enzyme Catalyzed Reactions,"Ayers, Kaitlynn; Abernathy, Natalie; Gannon, Sydney; Moseley, Marie; Rowley, John","The goal of this research was to compare the activation energy and rate constants of an enzyme catalyzed and a non-enzyme catalyzed hydrolysis reaction at different temperatures. NaOH was used as the non-enzyme catalyst and esterase was used as the enzyme catalyst. Using UV-Vis Spectroscopy, the catalyzed transformation from p-nitrophenylacetate to p-nitrophenol was observed. It was found through curve-fit analysis that the rate constants for both were temperature dependent. Arrhenius analysis utilizing these constants determined activation energies of 57.53 kJ/mol for the esterase and 58.02 kJ/mol for NaOH. These results suggest enzyme catalyzed reactions have a lower activation energy and therefore a faster rate of reaction than non-enzyme catalyzed reactions. "

Metal-oxide Photovoltaic Cells Synthesized using Materials Abundant in the Martian Regolith,"Radosevich, Timothy; Bailey, Marguerite; Wald, Elliot; Rowley, John","Solar cells were fabricated from iron containing minerals that are expected to be similar to those found in the Martian regolith: specular hematite, oolitic hematite, and hematite concretions. The solar cells were fabricated by electrophoretic deposition or drop casting of hematite nano-/micro-particles onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate (FTO). Samples were tested in a wet cell configuration with a 0.5 M NaI and 0.05 M I2 redox mediator, a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) supporting electrolyte, an acetonitrile solvent, and a platinum (Pt) counter electrode. Current-Potential (iP) curves were obtained under 1 sun (0.5 AMU at 100 mW/cm2) of white light illumination. Specular hematite generated the highest power output of 3.5 μW/cm2 yielding a power conversion efficiency of 4.6x10-3%. Wavelength dependent solar cell efficiency was also characterized using incident photon conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra, sample composition characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra, and surface morphology characterized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Preliminary results with electrolyte-free hematite solar cells will be discussed. "
MT Tech Mountain Bike Skills Park,"Harken, Carson; Burns, Nathan; Colgan, Aidan; Fischer, Gary","This senior civil engineering design project is focused on upgrading the existing Mountain Bike Skills Park at Montana Technical University in Butte, MT. Given the lack of existing data, this project poses a particular challenge to develop baseline surfaces for design. This project seeks to create a design that provides an excellent opportunity for outdoor recreation and exercise. We will include in our presentation a summary of all aspects of our project, including how we gathered topographic/survey data and property boundary information, designed a mountain bike course incorporating all skill levels, created engineering details for course features, improved signage, provided area-wide drawings that show connections or potential connections of other nearby biking opportunities, and created construction drawings and technical specifications for the proposed park upgrades.

Wausau Supply Parking Lot Design,"Gottwals, Van; Schake, Drake; Mancini, Ethan; Fischer, Gary","A location for a new Wausau Supply warehouse to be built has been proposed just outside Butte, Montana. Using provided survey data, geotechnical data, and Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) tools, we designed the site layout for a parking lot for the proposed building. We designed the parking lot and loading area in accordance with local county regulations using the American Association of State Highway and Traffic Officials Guide for Design of Pavement Structures assuming heavy loadings from the warehouse. We also considered the required drainage for the structures on site and designed a retention pond accordingly. Plans are drafted to complete construction along with all technical specifications. "
Study of a Diene / Dienophile System for Quantitative Determination of Activation Parameters for the Ruthenium-Sandwich Complex Acceleration of Diels-Alder Reaction,"Ackerman, Sebastian; Hitt, David","The Diels-Alder reaction involves two organic compounds possessing π systems, a diene and a dienophile, to form a 6-membered ring with a carbon-carbon π bond. Primarily used as a synthetic tool to create various medicinal compounds, Diels-Alder reactions can proceed at a reasonable rate by attaching an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) to the dienophile. Previous research by Carroll students in Dr. Hitt’s research program have shown (h5-cyclopentadienyl)ruthenium(II)(h6-aryl) substituents, [CpRu(h6-aryl)+], to be an effective EWG by facilitating the reaction of ethyl trans-cinnamate and 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene. For example, reacting [CpRu(h6-ethyl trans-cinnamate)]PF6 with 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene affords DA adduct under reflux conditions with nitromethane while reacting ethyl trans­-cinnamate with 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene afforded no product after 8 days of reflux. More detailed kinetic studies of the reaction, however, are hampered by the volatility of 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene which makes it difficult to control solute concentration. As a remedy, anthracene has been identified as a possible replacement as it is a crystalline, non-volatile solid at room temperature thus making its concentration easier to maintain under the high temperature reaction conditions. Herein, we report on our progress of using anthracene as a diene and [CpRu(h6 -ethyl trans-cinnamate)]PF6 as a dienophile. "
Synthesis of a Model CpFe(eta-6 -aryl) Substituted Dienophile,"Montowski, Claire","Diels-Alder (DA) reactions occur between two molecules, a diene and a dienophile, to form a six-membered ring. This structure is commonly found in natural products making it synthetically useful and causing the reaction to commonly be used in the formation of many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, under most circumstances, the DA reaction is limited by the dienophile needing an electron-withdrawing group to progress at a reasonable reaction rate. While there are numerous electron-withdrawing groups, most require chemical modification to be removed after the reaction. One possible alternative would be to use a dienophile containing an aryl substituent complexed to a (cyclopentadienyl)iron (II) monocationic fragment. This causes the attached 6-carbon ring to become electron-withdrawing, which would extend to the dienophile π-system as well. Furthermore, the metal fragment can later be removed by photolysis upon completion of the DA reaction. Previous research conducted with an analogous ruthenium complex displayed the metal fragment’s ability to accelerate the DA reaction compared to a control experiment with a non-metallated dienophile. The iron complex, by comparison, should have similar properties to the ruthenium complex based on its similar periodic properties and has the added benefit of being much less expensive and easier to remove photolytically. We will report our progress on synthesizing a model CpFe(η6 -aryl) substituted dienophile and on resulting studies into its reactivity in a DA reaction. Item Progress Toward the Synthesis of Next Generation Nonpeptidic Inhibitors of Sars-CoV-2 Main Protease (2023-04-28) Field, Cameren; Hitt, David The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, also known as 3CL, is a drug target of interest due to its critical function in cleaving the polyprotein which is translated from the viral RNA. Paxlovid, the FDA-approved drug from Pfizer, is a peptide-based inhibitor that covalently inhibits Mpro. My laboratory has developed a very potent series of nonpeptidic Mpro inhibitors that have several desirable properties compared to Paxlovid. The objective of this research was to develop a successful synthetic route to modify the lead nonpeptidic molecules in order to improve the pharmacological properties. The primary usefulness of the target molecule lies within its improved solubility in comparison to the lead inhibitor. Molecular modeling suggests that the target molecule will also increase the potency through an additional hydrogen bond to the Mpro enzyme. Herein is the reported progress toward the synthesis of next generation nonpeptidic inhibitors, CF1 and CF2. Use of 1H NMR and LC-MS spectral data for the synthetic intermediates was used to gauge the success of the chemical reactions within several attempted trials. CF1 has been successfully synthesized; its efficacy is being tested and the crystal structure of the compound bound to Mpro will be evaluated. "
The Synthesis of Renewable Surfactants Using Household Carbohydrates and Oils,"Chennai, Blake; Lohar, Noah; Carpenter, Chrissie","Surfactants are self-assembled molecular clusters, called micelles, that function by adsorbing to the interface between phases in a solution. This gives surfactants the unique ability to reduce the surface tension of the liquid in which it is dissolved. Surfactants are commonly used in lubricants, emulsifiers, adhesives, herbicides, and household detergents. However, as seen in recent years, synthetic surfactants, especially those found in herbicides, often contain toxic and carcinogenic chemicals, possibly causing harm to vast populations. In response, the necessity to synthesize non-toxic, renewable surfactants is evident. Using a three-step process, synthesizing renewable surfactants involves household sugars (monosaccharides and disaccharides) such as glucose and lactose, as well as fatty acids extracted from common cooking oils like canola and avocado oil. Gas Chromatography (GC-MS), Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and IR spectroscopy were used extensively to test for the purity and conformation of a desired product. Due to several 48-72 hour reaction procedures, the final surfactant product was not realized. However, each precursor component, including the non-polar hydrazone tail and polar carbohydrate head groups, was successfully synthesized using a vast diversity of carbohydrates and fatty acid combinations. In the future, a final reaction procedure between the polar carbohydrate head group and non-polar hydrazone tail would result in the final eco-friendly and renewable surfactant, which could then undergo experiments for relative efficacy. The successful synthesis of renewable, environmentally friendly, and effective surfactants is predicted to play a significant role in replacing toxic and carcinogenic surfactants used widely among several industries.

Analysis of Carbene Intermediates from Thiophene Ylides,"McJunkin, Malyn; Pharr, Caroline","Carbenes are a compound of interest in the chemistry community that can be found in abundance in interstellar space. Carbenes are neutral compounds consisting of a carbon atom with a lone electron pair and two bonds. The lone electron pair and lack of a full octet on carbon make the carbene an extremely reactive compound. Carbene intermediates readily create carbon-carbon bonds, making them useful in the synthesis of a host of important organic products including pharmaceuticals, plastics, and polymers, among others. This research focuses on the synthesis of sulfonium ylides as precursors to carbene intermediates. These precursor molecules will allow for the study of carbenes by varying the structure and electronic properties of these widely useful intermediates. "
Total Synthesis of 3-Oxyangeloyl-tremetone,"Deschamps, Natalee; Pharr, Caroline","Retrosynthetic analysis involves breaking a target molecule down into simpler structures to propose a synthetic pathway to its formation. This research project focuses on the retrosynthesis of a molecule with pharmaceutical applications. The compound of interest, 3-Oxyangeloyl-tremetone, has been extracted from a medicinal root in Chile and has shown analgesic activity (painkiller). Extraction from plants and other resources is often not feasible on a larger scale due to cost and logistics. The proposed five-step total synthesis of 3-Oxyangeloyl-tremetone utilizes inexpensive and readily available reagents. The first step of this synthesis has been completed and conditions to optimize the second step are currently underway. "
Convolution: Making Rendered Images Clearer,"Grosse, Jacob; Wendt, Ted","Realistic image rendering is a computationally expensive process that, even when done efficiently, can take hours, days, or even weeks to render a single image. This research is an explorative journey through making this process more efficient with unconventional means. Last semester (Fall 2022) was spent developing a ray-tracer, or an application which renders a scene by simulating light rays realistically. This process is done pixel by pixel for any given image and as such noise can be generated due to the somewhat random nature of light and how it bounces off different surfaces in simulation. The only solution to remove the noise generated from rendering the ray-traced images that was found during this development time was to simply render each pixel several thousand times and average the results, which results in an obscenely long runtime for the application. It is for this reason that we have chosen to explore the possibility of using neural networks, a series of functions that are organized into layers which are tweaked through the process of “training” to achieve a desired result. By training a neural network to take in noisy images and produce de-noised images, we can cut the processing time of producing high quality images significantly. We will quantify the improvement by using a metric we have created that we are calling aggregate pixel difference. This will measure the difference in color values between adjacent pixels and sum them across the whole image for a single value we wish to minimize. We will use this in conjunction with the mean squared error of the color values per pixel between the initial image and the smoothed image. The ratio at which we weight these will determine how much smoothing takes place, as weighting entirely into aggregate pixel difference will result in an image that is just a solid color and weighting entirely into mean squared error will result in the exact same image we put in.

The model or process of the neural network will analyze the image grid by grid trying to determine what symbol was drawn. "
A Stochastic Approach to Modeling the Effect of Biodiversity on Ecological Resilience,"Jarman, Anna; St. Marie, Olivia; Szpilka, Christopher; Cline, Kelly","The biodiversity of plants in an ecosystem enhances that ecosystem's ability to survive irregular weather patterns. In other words, an area with many different plant species will be more resistant to prolonged drought than an area with only a few different species. This phenomenon is commonly explained by the “insurance hypothesis,” which postulates that an ecosystem with greater biodiversity will be less volatile than its individual components due to statistical averaging. In this research study, we use Lotka-Volterra dynamics to model a single-trophic level plant ecosystem with both competitive and facilitative interactions between species. The facilitative interactions result in compensatory growth effects, where as the population of one species declines, another species in the same functional group increases its growth rate to compensate. We then apply drought conditions to the model, first implementing a stochastic simulation to determine the model parameters, then running a large number of trials for each number of species. Our findings show that as the number of species increases, the drought resilience of the system also increases asymptotically. These results are in accordance with experimental findings, supporting the insurance hypothesis. "
Analyzing 2018 NFL Passing Data,"Anderson, Nicholas; Cline, Kelly","This research used the data from all the passing plays in the 2018 NFL season and analyzed the offensive and defensive player configurations. To do this we used ANOVA to analyze whether there is a significant difference between the yardage gained or lost for different offensive or defensive configurations. If there was a significant difference, then we used TukeyHSD to determine specifically which configurations were significantly different from one another. From the analysis we determined that when running a defensive personnel with four defensive lineman, three linebackers, and four defensive backs, that on average the defense is going to allow more yards than playing with any of the other defensive personnel. The offensive personnel analysis shows that when running an offense with 11 personnel, the offense is on average going to gain fewer yards than running plays with 12 or 21 personnel. The box defenders analysis shows that when running a defense with seven box defenders, that the defense is on average going to allow more yards than running plays with five or six box defenders. We studied a linear model of the number of pass rushers compared to the outcome of the play finding that for every additional pass rusher there is on average going to be a quarter less of a yard gained per play. It is important to consider which player configurations to run because certain configurations will allow the team to net the most amount of yards. "

"Trippin’ on Chai: The Effects of Nutmeg on Pain, Anxiety, Depression, and TRPA1 expression in Drosophila melanogaster","Breit, Julianna; Gnoyski, Alyssa; Miller, Christine","Nutmeg, a spice often associated with chai and Christmas cookies, has been used as a natural health remedy throughout the centuries to alleviate pain, depression, and anxiety. To empirically investigate this traditional remedy, we analyzed the effects of nutmeg on these symptoms in the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, the common fruit fly. We hypothesized that oral-administration of nutmeg would reduce the levels of pain, anxiety, and depression experienced by D. melanogaster. To test this hypothesis, thermal noxious stimulus assays, a light avoidance and geotaxis assay, and a forced swim test were used to measure pain, anxiety, and depression, respectively. In addition, RT-qPCR was used to measure expression of the pain-response gene, TRPA1. Ultimately, we found that only the larval thermal noxious stimulus assay and RT-qPCR produced statistically significant results (p<0.05), despite apparent shifts in the other performed assays. While we observed both physical and gene expression differences in the nutmeg-treated D. melanogaster, we recognize that further research must be conducted to determine how much nutmeg impacts pain, anxiety, depression, and TRPA1 expression in the common fruit fly.

The Effects of Prilosec OTC™ on Gastric Health in Tetrahymena thermophila,"Nowlen, Maycee; Cabezas, Alexis; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","Heartburn is defined as a burning sensation in the chest caused by stomach acid traveling up into the esophagus. This symptom is experienced by millions of people every day and has been linked to a variety of health-related factors including diet and weight. The most common treatment for heartburn is a class of drugs called Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs) that restrict production of stomach acids by the digestive glands. Omeprazole, also known as Prilosec OTC™, is the most widely used over-the-counter PPI. Despite their frequent usage, the potential adverse effects of PPIs are poorly understood. Recent research has revealed a correlation between the consistent use of PPIs and the development of gastric cancer, with the use of PPIs causing a threefold increase in the propensity for developing gastric malignancy (Abrahami, 2022). This study aims to further the research on this topic using the model organism Tetrahymena thermophila. It was hypothesized that consistent administration of Prilosec OTC™ to T. thermophila cultures would alter expression of the gastric cancer-related TKU80 and PA26 p53-induced (PA26) genes as measured by Reverse Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). It was further hypothesized that Prilosec OTC™ would impact metabolic activity, cell growth, and feeding ability as determined using the behavioral assays of cell counting, vacuole staining, and deciliation. On account of the adverse effects of PPIs reported by prior research, it was predicted that there would be an upregulation of both TKU80 and PA26 along with inhibited feeding ability and increased cell growth and metabolic activity.

"Effects of Melatonin on Movement, Metabolism, and Growth in Blue Light-exposed Tetrahymena thermophila","Winkler, Amaya; Eifler, Seth; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","As of 2016, 73 percent of young Americans suffered from symptoms related to blue light exposure including eye strain, sleep disruption, and difficulty focusing. This number has likely grown dramatically since 2016 given the increased use of blue light-emitting devices including cell phones, tablets, computers, and televisions. Blue light exposure has been shown to reduce the levels of melatonin in humans, which is an important regulator of our sleep-wake cycle. To further the research in this area, we investigated the effects of melatonin on cell growth and metabolism in the model organism, Tetrahymena thermophila, after exposing them to blue light. We hypothesized that blue light-exposed T. thermophila treated with melatonin would exhibit altered cell growth and movement along with changes in their metabolic function. To test our hypothesis, T. thermophila cells were exposed to blue light over a 48-hour period either in the presence or absence of 2.32E-6 mg/mL melatonin; the amount proportional to an average human. The effects of melatonin on cell growth was measured using a cell count assay and through analysis of the cell cycle control gene, CDC7, by Reverse Transcriptase quantitative-polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Furthermore, the impact of melatonin on metabolism was measured using both motility and deciliation assays along with quantifying expression of the BSU2 gene by RT-qPCR. The addition of melatonin to blue light-exposed T. thermophila was predicted to decrease cell growth, motility, and CDC7 gene expression while increasing protein metabolism and expression of BSU2. "
"The effects of the homeopathic supplements, Addrell and StressCalm, on hyper- and hypoactivity in Tetrahymena thermophila","Bailey, Marguerite; Field, Cameren; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","In the United States alone, approximately 20% of adults have been diagnosed with a mental illness, resulting in the increased usage of prescription mood-altering medications. In looking for alternative treatment options, consumers have turned to homeopathic supplements that allegedly mimic the effects of these medications. For example, Addrell is marketed as an alternative to prescription stimulants while StressCalm is being marketed as a mood stabilizer. Unlike prescription medications, homeopathic supplements are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration and their claims of effectiveness are not substantiated by research. The objective of this study was to determine whether Addrell and StressCalm affect energy production and related behaviors in the model organism, Tetrahymena thermophila. Based on their marketing, it was hypothesized that Addrell and StressCalm would alter the expression of genes related to energy production, namely SLC1, ACO1, and AAC1, and affect motility, growth, feeding and metabolic rates of T. thermophila. To investigate this hypothesis, experimental T. thermophila were exposed to appropriately scaled doses of either Addrell or StressCalm for 48 hours. Following the exposure, motility, growth, feeding, and deciliation assays were performed on the T. thermophila along with RNA extraction and RT-qPCR to measure expression of SLC1, ACO1, and AAC1. Addrell exposure was predicted to induce hyperactivity, causing escalated motility, growth, feeding, and metabolic rate along with increased expression of AAC1, ACO1, and SLC. Meanwhile, StressCalm was predicted to induce hypoactivity, resulting in decreased motility, growth, feeding and metabolic rate as well as reduced expression of SLC1, AAC1, and ACO1. "
"The Effects of Pre-Workout on Expression of the fruitless Gene, Reproductive Rates, Motor Coordination, and Courtship Behaviors in Drosophila melanogaster","Lohr, Kelsyn; Wohlers, Joseph; Chennai, Blake; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","Pre-workout is a nutritional supplement that is promoted to enhance athletic performance via increased energy levels, improvement of exercise performance, and stimulating muscle growth. As a supplement, Pre-workout products are not required to get approval by the Food and Drug Administration and research on the effects of Pre-workout is extremely limited. Based on the contents of many Pre-workout products, we believe that the supplement will have similar effects on Drosophila melanogaster as caffeine, which has previously been shown to alter their behavior. Pre-workout supplements are widely consumed and can reach up to 300 mg of caffeine in just one serving. We hypothesized that the addition of Pre-workout into the diet of male D. melanogaster would increase courtship behaviors, reproductive rates, motor function, and expression of the fruitless (fru) gene, which plays a role in courtship-related motor neuron function. To determine the effects of Pre-workout on D. melanogaster, we performed behavioral assays on reproductive rate, motor coordination, and courtship behavior and used RT-qPCR to quantify expression of the fru gene. The results from this study showed there was a significant difference in motor coordination between the control and Pre-workout treated flies; however, no significant difference was observed in courtship behavior, reproductive rate, or expression of the fru gene.

The Effects of Tik Tok Exposure on Vesicular Monoamine Transporter (VMAT) Gene Expression and Aggressive/Anxious Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster,"Armstrong, Isaac; Hartwig, Iris; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","Tik Tok, a social media platform designed as an endless stream of short-form video content, was the most downloaded app globally in 2021 (Statista 2022). Along with the increasing popularity and use of social media among teenagers and young adults, the past 25 years have shown a 70% increase in the prevalence of anxious and depressive symptoms in young populations (Keles et al. 2020). Additional research has found connections between social media use and physiological distress including anxiety, depression, stress, negative social comparisons, and decreased life satisfaction (Keles et al. 2020; Chung-Ying et al. 2021; Fardouly et al. 2018). The goal of this study was to measure the effect of Tik Tok exposure on aggression, anxiety, and Vesicular Monoamine Transporter (VMAT) expression in Drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly). We hypothesized that Tik Tok exposure would increase aggressive and anxious behaviors in D. melanogaster and increase VMAT expression resulting in higher levels of dopamine and octopamine transport into synaptic vesicles. To test our hypothesis, experimental flies were exposed to Tik Tok for 10 minutes and recorded to track their aggressive interactions and anxious wall-following behavior. To analyze VMAT expression, RNA extraction and RT-qPCR was performed on the flies after the behavioral assays. The results of our study indicate there is no significant difference in anxious behavior or expression of the VMAT gene after exposure to Tik Tok. Significantly, an increase in aggressive interactions was observed following Tik Tok exposure. "
"The Effects of Acetaminophen on DAT and LRRK2 Gene Expression and Geotaxis, Phototaxis and Mating Behavior in Drosophila melanogaster","Goulet, Elaina; Cabezas, Alexis; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","Acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, is a widely used analgesic that acts as a pain reliever. In the United States alone, over 60 million doses of acetaminophen are consumed on a weekly basis (Bohler et al., 2019). Despite its frequent use, the adverse effects of consuming high levels of acetaminophen are not well-known. Previous studies have shown that there is a correlation between individuals that consume high levels of acetaminophen and their predisposition to the development of Parkinson’s Disease (Bohler et al., 2019). The goal of this study was to explore the effects of high doses of acetaminophen on expression of the Parkinson’s Disease-related LRRK2 and DAT genes, as well as the motor function, light sensitivity, and reproductive rates of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesized that high levels of acetaminophen would increase expression of LRRK2 and DAT, while decreasing motor function, light sensitivity and reproductive rates in the flies. To test this hypothesis, an acetaminophen concentration of 0.018mg/1mL was prepared in water and ethanol and was added to the culturing media of the experimental group, while the control group media received only water and ethanol. Following the treatment period, D. melanogaster were subjected to RT-qPCR to measure expression of LRRK2 and DAT, as well as behavioral assays including geotaxis, phototaxis, and mating. The results showed there was a significant increase in expression of the LRRK2 and DAT genes; however there was not a significant difference in the geotaxis, phototaxis, or mating behaviors. "
"The heavy metal content in Helena freshwater sources and its effects on IFT122 expression, cell motility, and viability of Tetrahymena thermophila","Bourekis, Kiki; Ward, Michael; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","Throughout its history, Montana has been known for its mining operations, most prominently for silver, lead and copper. Heavy metal runoff from these mines has contaminated freshwater sources across the state, and these heavy metals are known to be carcinogenic and mutagenic, increasing both oxidative stress and cell damage in organisms. For this research study, we investigated how heavy metals within freshwater sources around Helena influenced motility and viability of the model organism, Tetrahymena thermophila. We hypothesized that Helena freshwater sources containing heavy metals would alter IFT122 expression, as well as motility, cilia regeneration, and cell growth. The IFT122 gene encodes the Intraflagellar Transport Protein, which plays an essential role in returning IFT proteins from the ciliary tip to the cell body during ciliary regeneration. To test our hypothesis, T. thermophila were cultured for 48 hours either in store bought spring water or in freshwater samples from Prickly Pear Creek, Silver Creek, or Ten Mile Creek. During the 48-hour exposure, T. thermophila growth was monitored for all groups using a cell count assay. At the end of the treatment period, motility and deciliation assays were performed to analyze ciliary function and Reverse Transcription -quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to measure IFT122 expression. Given the harmful impacts of heavy metal exposure on cell function, it was predicted that T. thermophila cultured in freshwater samples from around Helena would exhibit decreased IFT122 expression along with reduced cell viability and motility when compared to contaminated water due to the disruption of ciliary function by these heavy metals.

"Effects of the SSRI antidepressant, Lexapro, on metabolic rate and addictive behaviors in Tetrahymena thermophila","Borzadek, Sofie; Jones, Amber; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications, such as escitalopram (Lexapro), are increasingly being prescribed to individuals as young as 12 years old. This is concerning given the side effects of these medications, including changes in appetite, mood, and withdrawal-related symptoms. The purpose of this research was to determine the effect of escitalopram on feeding, motility, and addiction in Tetrahymena thermophila. The impact of escitalopram on expression of GTR4, which encodes a glucose transporter involved in metabolism, was also characterized. Given its known side effects in humans, it was hypothesized that escitalopram would alter the expression of GTR4 while also impacting feeding, motility, and addictive responses in T. thermophila. To test this hypothesis, T. thermophila were cultured for 48 hours either in media without escitalopram or with an equivalent dose of the medication scaled to the average weight of a 12-year-old. Following the 48-hour incubation, feeding behavior was measured using a phagocytosis assay, movement was assessed using a motility assay, and addictive behavior was analyzed by tracking cell movement after re-exposure to escitalopram. To measure GTR4 expression, RNA was extracted from the cultures and RT-qPCR was performed on the control and escitalopram-treated cells. It was predicted that GTR4 expression would increase given the higher levels of serotonin and subsequent increased metabolic activity, resulting in a heightened need for glucose. Furthermore, it was anticipated that feeding behavior would increase along with addictive responses, while motility would decrease, as the T. thermophila shifted their energy usage in the presence of escitalopram.

The effects of natural and artificial flavors on the membrane integrity of Tetrahymena thermophila,"Nelson, Carrie; Tekverk, Amy; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","In recent years, food companies have been promoting the use of natural flavorings, as opposed to artificial ones, given consumer perception that ‘natural’ means ‘healthy’. Despite this change, the criteria established by the Food and Drug Administration for what constitutes a natural flavoring lacks clarity. In fact, natural flavorings have been shown to cause severe health issues, such as with natural butter flavoring, which can cause bronchiolitis obliterans (aka “popcorn lung”). To better understand how artificial and natural butter flavorings impact the plasma membrane, the model organism Tetrahymena thermophila was used to mimic the gas exchange process within human lung tissue. For this study, we hypothesized that exposure to these flavorings would alter expression of the YMR210W gene, which plays a role and lipid synthesis, and the FLP1 gene, which encodes a flippase protein that moves phospholipids within the membrane. Furthermore, we hypothesized that both butter flavorings would impact motility, cell signaling, cell growth, and feeding ability. To test our hypothesis, T. thermophila were cultured in media with or without flavoring for 48 hours. During the exposure period, feeding ability and cell growth were measured, while at the end of the exposure period, cell motility was measured, along with expression of YMR210W and FLP1 via RT-qPCR. We predicted that the artificial and natural butter flavorings would increase expression of YMR210W, decrease expression of FLP1, and subsequently decrease feeding, growth, and motility due to the negative impact these flavorings have on the integrity of the plasma membrane in T. thermophila.

"Pesticide-induced oxidative stress and its effects on cell growth, feeding, and motility in Tetrahymena thermophila","Doyle, Sophia; Nessan, Erica; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","In the United States alone, an estimated 1 billion pounds of conventional pesticides, including insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, are used annually. This widespread use is occurring with little regard to research showing that pesticides cause oxidative stress in humans by disrupting the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidant mechanisms. The resulting ROS accumulation can lead to double-stranded DNA breaks, with several studies linking this damage to aging-related diseases. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and related behaviors in the model organism, Tetrahymena thermophila. It was hypothesized that pesticide exposure would alter expression of the MXR1 gene, which plays a role in the cellular response to oxidative stress, as well as impact cell growth, phagocytosis, and motility. To test this hypothesis, T. thermophila cultures were assigned to a control or treatment group; the treatment group cultures were exposed to 0.5% Roundup, Raid, or Copper Fungicide for 48 hours. During the 48-hour incubation period, cell growth and feeding were measured using a growth assay and an India ink feeding assay, respectively. At the end of the 48-hour incubation, T. thermophila movement was characterized using a cell motility assay followed by RNA extraction and RT-qPCR to measure the expression of MXR1. Given the known impact of pesticides on the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, it was predicted that T. thermophila cultures exposed to pesticides would exhibit increased MXR1 expression and subsequent decreases in growth rate, feeding activity, and cell motility.

The effect of a youth activating cosmetic filler on Botox-related genes and behaviors in Tetrahymena thermophila,"Moseley, Marie; Greene, Sarah; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","With an estimated 4.4 million people in the United States using Botulinum neurotoxin (Botox) for cosmetic purposes, there has been a steady increase in the marketing of Botox-alternatives, like Invinity’s Youth Activating Cosmetic Filler. Produced by Clostridium botulinum, Botox inhibits acetylcholine binding at the neuromuscular junction, causing temporary paralysis of targeted muscles and reducing wrinkles. For this research study, we wanted to determine whether Invinity’s Cosmetic Filler acted on the same genetic and behavioral pathways as Botox in the model organism, Tetrahymena thermophila. We hypothesized that T. thermophila treated with Invinity’s Cosmetic Filler would exhibit altered expression of the SEC1 and LC4A genes and changes in cell growth, feeding, and motility; SEC1 and LC4A were chosen given their involvement in acetylcholine regulation and calcium signaling, respectively. To test our hypothesis, T. thermophila culture media was supplemented with Invinity’s Cosmetic Filler at a dose relative to the amount a human would receive but scaled to the size of T. thermophila; the control group did not receive the cosmetic filler. After 48 hours, cell growth, feeding, and motility assays were performed on the T. thermophila to determine how Invinity’s Cosmetic Filler impacted these behaviors. Following the behavioral assays, the cultures were subjected to RNA extraction and RT-qPCR for the analysis of SEC1 and LC4A gene expression. Treatment of T. thermophila with Invinity’s Cosmetic Filler was predicted to decrease expression of SEC1 and LC4A and decrease cell motility, growth, and phagocytosis in a manner similar to that which is observed with Botox treatment.

The Development and Implementation of Classical Edge Detection Algorithms,"Mancini, Ethan; Cline, Kelly","Within the field of computer vision, edge detection was developed in the 1960s as a method of finding borders within images by using Taylor series to approximate the gradient of a grayscale image. Within the context of mathematics, we review the development of these early edge detection methods including the Canny, Sobel, and Prewitt operators. We implement these algorithms with computer code for demonstration purposes and compare the effectiveness of these early methods on modern applications of edge detection such as quality control in manufacturing and tree-ring counting. Additionally, we consider the development of historical methods for improving the usefulness of outputs including automated edge removal through thresholding using Ostu’s Method and pre-filtering using a Gaussian filter. We evaluate these historical methods after implementation in code on several edge detection operators. "
Beating the Pandemic: An Optimization Approach to Board Game Strategy,"Jarman, Anna; Fasteen, Jodi",Pandemic: Hot Zone is a board game in which players work together to research and find cures for 3 diseases before the diseases overtake the game board. It is an intricate board game that is part strategy and part luck. In this project we attempt to discover an effective strategic framework for playing the game which will give players the best probability of winning. A systematic approach to Pandemic strategy is taken by implementing a computer simulation of the game and training models to play it. An objective function is defined in order to quantify by how much models 'win' or 'lose.' Different models are implemented using an optimal control approach to find an efficient strategical guide for decision-making while playing the game. Parameters are altered within models using an optimization approach to discover optimal strategic balance between various tough choices players must make.
