Gender Disparity In Broadway Sound Design,"Southworth, Tabitha","Sound design is a field that has been historically dominated by men. Especially in the elite Broadway sector, it has been difficult for female sound designers to break in. Carroll College’s She Persisted study collected data on the gender of sound designers of Broadway shows from 2011-2021. I have used this data to compare the number of shows that have run on Broadway to the number of female sound designers who have worked on the Broadway stage over the last ten years. Of the 369 shows that have run on Broadway, twelve have featured female-identifying sound designers. In this project, I have provided several theories as to why sound design might be the most difficult area of theatre for women to break into on a professional level. "
Work and Labor Songs of Butte Montana: An Audio Experience of the Past,"Duff, Arizona; Fregulia, Jeanette; Marchesini, Maren; Cash, Dane","Work and labor songs paint a picture about what life was like for working class people throughout history. In the United States, we have seen songs rise and fall in popularity representing groups of workers, from the coal mines in Kentucky to the striking General Motor workers in Flint, Michigan. While the lyrics and stories of these songs contain deep meaning in their own right, the music and the presentation of the pieces are also a critical aspect in understanding the historical significance of these songs. This project explores the work and labor songs from the mining community of Butte, Montana and what this music, experienced as music, can teach us. Using music books, union pamphlets, and field and audio recordings collected throughout the 20th century, I explore what it sounded like to be a miner. "
Concentration of Metals in Remediated vs Non-Remediated Soils,"Olmes, Nathan; Post, William; Winn, Hannah; O'Sullivan, Joseph; Heiser, Patricia","East Helena, Montana was the site of a lead smelter, operated by ASARCO from 1888-2001, which became a source of heavy metal contamination that was dispersed through surface water, groundwater, soils, and air. The entire city of East Helena became an EPA Superfund site and cleanup of contaminated surface soils began in 2010. In many instances, topsoil was removed from yards and parks, and transported to treatment sites. Prickly Pear Land Trust (PPLT) has acquired several parcels of land and is making efforts to remediate the soil and eventually make it safe for public use. In particular, an 80-acre parcel north of Kennedy Park remained untreated. PPLT has begun remediation efforts using the method of turning soils in order to disperse contamination and reduce the concentration of heavy metals at the surface. This project will assess metals concentrations in surface soils in areas that were previously remediated, are currently undergoing remediation, and along Prickly Pear Creek where soils remain undisturbed. Soil samples from each of these surfaces will be analyzed using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF). The data will provide heavy metal concentration in ppm and will be compared with each other as well as baseline surveys conducted before remediation actions. The results of this study will be presented as a map representing metals in surface soils across the study area, as well as comparisons with baseline and nearby remediated areas. This project will assist in overall restoration efforts and will help evaluate the success of remediation. "
Did an Ice Cap Cover the Flint Creek Range?,"Hadley, Ashelynn; Worden, Garrett; Yocum, Natalie; Sater, Shane; Heiser, Patricia","During the last glacial maximum (LGM), glaciers occupied many ranges in the mountain west. In the vicinity of Racetrack Creek and Fred Burr Creek in the Flint Creek Range, west-central Montana, glaciers left clear moraines marking maximum extent into lower valleys on either side of the range. ‘Trimlines’ marking former ice surface suggest that an ice cap might have joined the glaciers at the top of the range. Surficial geologic mapping of the lower Racetrack Creek valley allowed us to reconstruct ice thickness as it exited the range. We then used a mathematical model (based on physical properties of ice, slope, and basal shear stress) to reconstruct former ice surface to the divide. Our model matched closely with the constraining physical data, indicating that a small ice cap fed the two outlet glaciers during the LGM. The ice cap did not completely cover the top of the range, leaving protruding peaks or ‘nunataks’. The glacial equilibrium line altitude (ELA) was 2,130 meters in the Fred Burr Creek valley and 70 meters lower in the Racetrack Creek valley, indicating that ice extended lower on the east of the range. These results provide an important contribution to the understanding of glacial history in the Flint Creek Range and growing body of data on glacial and climate history of the mountain west. The ELA we determined are over 250 meters lower than those previously estimated for this area, suggesting that the local climate was colder and/or wetter than previously interpreted. "
Accessibility Scan of Carroll College,"4) Shepherd, Eliza; Koster, Kami; Wilkinson, Genesis; VanSickle, Emma; Jones, Sadie; Olney, Bridget; Kraut, Grace; Cook, Breanna; Parsley, Kelly","Research done in a national study in 2011 found that only 34 percent of college students with disabilities will complete a 4 year program (NLTS2: Home, n.d.). This is due to numerous issues with accessibility on college campuses. While many colleges support students with physical disabilities, many do so from the standpoint of legal compliance instead of bettering campus and classroom accessibility. Student researchers were concerned about Carroll College's accessibility for people with physical disabilities. They wanted to see how accessible Carroll is, especially from the standpoint of someone who uses a mobility aid. Student researchers conducted interviews, focus groups, and environmental scans, in order to gather results. Interviews showed that Carroll students and faculty thought that prospective students with a preexisting physical disability would not feel comfortable joining the Carroll community due to a lack of accessibility. Environmental scans revealed that even though there are accessible entrances to buildings, they are not realistic for long term or daily use. In Guadalupe Hall specifically, the only way to get to the accessible bathroom on the men’s side is to exit the building, re-enter through the Wellness Center door, take the elevator to the first floor, and use the bathroom by the computer lab. There are no accessible bathrooms for the women’s floors. This research will be used to inform Carroll on ways that campus can be made more accessible, therefore further embodying the mission of “welcoming all persons” as per the mission statement. "
Misguided Praxis: Twitter’s Response to Justine Sacco’s infamous tweet,"Thyssen, Abigail; Hansen, Alan","In 2013, then Senior Director of Corporate Communications at InterActive Corporation (IAC) Justine Sacco said to the 170 people following her on Twitter, “Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!” This tweet, posted just prior to Sacco boarding her 11-hour flight from London to South Africa to see her father, was trending worldwide and accumulating a great amount of negative attention just six hours later. In this paper, I conduct a critical analysis of this case by taking up the notion of “praxis” – analysis of experience to facilitate reflection and foment change. Not only can we engage in praxis by reflecting on the case of Sacco’s tweet and the firestorm that followed, but we also see how it is that social media users themselves appear to attempt to engage in a kind of praxis, but do so in misguided and ultimately dangerous ways.

Seasonal Stream Flow Analysis and Channel Stability on Recently Restored Sevenmile Creek - Comparison of Before and After Restoration,"Grigsby, Brady; Vosen, Ryan; Hagengruber, Joe; Quick, Conor; Heiser, Patricia","Sevenmile Creek, located northwest of Helena, Montana had a deeply incised stream channel and altered riparian zone due to historical agriculture influences. Prickly Pear Land Trust began restoration efforts on Sevenmile Creek in the fall of 2017 with a goal of restoring the floodplain and streamside vegetation to positively impact the surrounding ecosystem. The restoration project was divided into four reaches, with upstream Reaches 1 and 2 receiving the least amount of restoration work and were mainly unaltered. Reaches 3 and 4 were the most impacted and incised. In those reaches the old channel was filled and the active channel returned to a more natural form and floodplain. Our study aims to quantify changes in channel form and floodplain before, during and after restoration activity along Reach 4 of Sevenmile Creek. In November 2021, the ES 381 Landscape Analysis class measured four cross-channel profiles along the newly restored Reach 4. These will be compared with similar profiles measured in 2019 before restoration efforts began. Spring floods in 2021 (prior to our fall survey) caused Sevenmile Creek to avulse its new channel in one area encompassed by our survey. The avulsed area was ‘repaired’ in winter 2022. We will conduct several more surveys this spring, before and after spring runoff, to quantify any channel changes and assess the progress and effectiveness of restoration efforts. This study will help assess the success of the restoration project and will allow for a continued examination of the Sevenmile Creek in the coming years. "
Age and Growth Rate of Trees Along Forest-Meadow Ecotones,"Winn, Hannah; Heiser, Patricia","The Forest-Meadow ecotone, a transitional zone between two different plant communities, is common around Montana and especially the eastern flank of the continental divide. These boundaries are often rich in different plant, animal and bird species and could play a role in helping us better understand our forests and how they might respond to climate change. In observing these areas, where slopes change in aspect from north to south, the forest and meadow boundary line is very distinct. In some areas the boundary is more diffuse. We have observed in some areas that trees along the edge of the meadow are noticeably smaller than the ones located in the tree stand. This phenomenon raises a few questions; are these smaller ‘meadow trees’ younger, indicating that the forest is extending out? Or are they older trees under some sort of stress-induced factor that is limiting their growth and the stand boundary is either stable or possibly retreating? My research will take place in a non-grazed forest-meadow ecotone west of Helena, and will be focused on answering these questions which will then hopefully give a better understanding on how these ecotones can help us understand the future of our forests and the effects the change in climate could have on them.

High Definition Elemental Analysis of Lake Helena Sediments,"Ross, Alison; Graham, Brette; Benjamin, Kevin; Heiser, Patricia","Lake Helena has been impacted by heavy metal contamination as a result of historic mining and ore processing impacts on surrounding streams. Located in the northeastern area of the Helena Valley, Lake Helena is primarily fed by Prickly Pear Creek and Tenmile Creeks, and was formed when Hauser Dam was installed on the Missouri River in the early 1900s. Lake sediment cores are used to study changes in sediments over time, which in turn, reflect climate change as well as human impacts on a landscape. Previous studies, on core samples taken from near the delta on the west end of the lake, focused on flood history. This study uses cores taken from areas where historic wetlands possibly existed, closer to the northeast corner of the lake. These pre-Lake Helena wetlands may provide a longer sediment record (pre-dam), and will examine the lake sediments for differences in heavy metal concentrations pre- and post- mining activity. The Environmental Landscape Analysis class (ES 382) obtained several sediment cores from the NE fishing access of Lake Helena using a Livingston square rod position corer. Using X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) the cores will be analyzed at one centimeter intervals to determine the concentrations of heavy metals such as copper, lead, cadmium, nickel, selenium, and iron. These longer cores will then be compared with the previous cores from the west end of the lake. The results of this study will quantify the changes in heavy metal contamination over time and space within the lake. "
Characterization of Metabolomic Profiles of Encapsulated Chondrocytes Exposed to Short-Term Simulated Microgravity: A Pilot Study,"Glimm, Matthew; Bergstrom, Annika; Houske, Eden; Hahn, Alyssa","Mechanical loading of cartilage stimulates chondrocyte metabolism to maintain cartilage integrity. Shifts from physiological loading conditions, such as overloading or reduced loading, can lead to an imbalance in chondrocyte metabolism, leading to early osteoarthritis (OA). This is of particular concern in space, where reduced mechanical forces during prolonged microgravity exposure (10-6 G) could lead to OA and compromise flight crew mobility, resulting in incomplete mission duties. Thus, the goal of this pilot study was to expand our understanding of the risk of developing OA post spaceflight through a deeper understanding of chondrocyte mechanotransduction. To do this, we encapsulated human chondrocytes in an agarose gel of similar stiffness to the pericellular matrix to better stimulate the cartilage microenvironment and exposed these encapsulated chondrocyte constructs to simulated microgravity (SM) using a rotating wall vessel (RWV) bioreactor. We analyzed the response to SM using global metabolomic profiling to gain an untargeted and unbiased view of metabolic shifts. These results suggest that short-term (<4 days) exposure to microgravity does not induce large-scale shifts in chondrocyte metabolism. However, the metabolic shifts that occurred in response to microgravity exposure were consistent with early OA metabolomic profiles in human synovial fluid which could suggest that even short-term exposure to microgravity may lead to the development of OA. This work enhances our ability to study chondrocyte mechanotransduction in SM in vitro by encapsulating chondrocytes in a three-dimensional agarose construct of relevant physiological stiffness that better stimulates the cartilage microenvironment.

An Analysis of the Representation of Swans in Heinz and Aronofsky's 'Black Swan',"Spanfelner, Sydney; DeMello, Margo","The 2010 film ‘Black Swan’ brings stereotypes of swans and femininity into the spotlight. Based on the ballet ‘Swan Lake’, this film is heavily influenced by the lore surrounding both the black and the white swan. While this is a commentary of the swan itself, it also plays a part in a larger conversation about gender roles and their consequences. The film follows Nina, a ballerina who is awarded the star role in her dance studio’s annual production of Swan Lake. Nina is expected to be able to (without-flaw) perform the role of the sweet, innocent white swan as well as the cynical, evil black swan. As Nina pushes herself to achieve this duality perfectly, she is overcome by paranoia and begins to see herself become a swan. The film uses costume, color, gender, makeup, and the use of swans to showcase Nina’s gradual descent into her new reality. The film ultimately uses these themes and techniques to comment on the fragility of femininity and how this obsession with perfect femininity is our ultimate demise. "
Littlebrook Creek Culvert Replacement,"Homberg, Sarah; Swannack, Sienna; Fischer, Gary","Littlebrook Creek is a tributary of Thornton Creek, located in North Seattle. Under NE 120th Street, between NE 35th Ave and 36th Ave, there is a culvert that runs perpendicular under the street that is collapsing. This culvert is also a barrier to salmon passage during spawning season because the culvert invert is too high above the creek bottom on the downstream side. A new long-term solution needs to be installed, otherwise the culvert could fail, causing NE 120th Street to collapse which would result in the damming of the stream and pooling of water from the stream potentially overflowing into neighbors’ yards. This project will consist of designing a replacement culvert. It will include removing the asphalt road, excavating soil, and removing the current thirty-inch concrete culvert in order for a sustainable replacement to be installed. The creek will have to continue to flow throughout construction which means that water will have to be dammed upstream of NE 120th Street and the water pumped across the street and released downstream, allowing for a dry construction area. Measures will need to be taken to prevent debris from construction contaminating the stream. Through diverting the water from upstream to downstream it will help with contamination prevention. Construction must also take place in the window of time that will not impede salmon migration. "
The Riemann Zeta Function,"Carstens, Johnny; Sullivan, Eric","The Riemann Zeta function is an enigma for mathematicians. What is more famously known is the Riemann Hypothesis, which was introduced to the world formally by David Hilbert in 1900 as one of his 23 unsolved problems. This problem has gone unsolved for 163 years and counting.The zeta function was first introduced by Leonhard Euler in the mid 18th century where it was defined over the real numbers. Euler then makes a monumental connection between the zeta function and the product of prime numbers, here the zeta function gains its infamy. Bernhard Riemann comes along in 1859 and extends the zeta function to the complex numbers. In doing so, he introduces his famous hypothesis ”The non trivial zeros of the function have a real part of 1/2 ”. This hypothesis implies that we can gain insight into the distribution of the prime numbers. In mathematics, we can calculate how many prime numbers there are in a defined interval, but we don’t know how to locate them.We intend to look at the Riemann Zeta function through two lenses, graphically and analytically. We explore how this function behaves under certain conditions and assumptions, while also being able to make meaningful visualizations that helps us understand the behavior of this function. We will also examine the analytic continuation of the Riemann Zeta function, which is the key element that allows the Riemann Hypothesis to exist in the first place. We will also look at the progress being made to solve this hypothesis. "
Synthesis of Renewable Surfactants,"Schuh, Logan; Dailey, Orrin; Carpenter, Chrissie; Carpenter, Chrissie","Herbicides such as Roundup are used to kill unwanted plants. These products utilize glyphosate as the active ingredient and were previously believed to be carcinogenic and related to cancer development. Multiple carcinogenicity studies have been carried out and numerous regulatory agencies have determined that the data does not support a link between glyphosate and cancer.1 However, it has been reported that surfactants, another ingredient in common herbicides, are more toxic than glyphosate itself.2 Surfactants are used to overcome solubility problems and to facilitate the dispersal of molecules in a solution. In order to create herbicide products with less toxicity to humans, new surfactants are being synthesized and researched.2 The aim of this research project is to create non-toxic surfactants using green and renewable resources such as natural carbohydrates and fatty acids. The resulting surfactants will be characterized, and their properties tested with the goal of creating less toxic, natural, and renewable surfactants to be used in products like Roundup. "
Metal-oxide p-n Photovoltaic Junctions Synthesized using Materials Abundant in the Martian Sathrolith utilizing the Electrophoretic Deposition Technique,"Radosevich, Timothy; Bailey, Marguerite; Wald, Elliot; Bailey, Marguerite; Rowley, John","Operational solar cells were fabricated using hematite (Fe2O3) as the light absorbing substrate. Some of the solar cells were fabricated using hematite minerals or ores that may be similar to those found in the Martian regolith; specifically, samples of: specular hematite, oolitic hematite, and hematite concretions. The light absorbing electrode was fabricated using three different techniques: electrophoretic deposition, spin coating, and solvent evaporation of the hematite samples onto a fluorine-doped tin oxide substrate (FTO). The dark electrode was a platinum (Pt) coated FTO and the redox mediator was 0.5 M NaI, 0.05 M I2, in acetonitrile with a 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) electrolyte. Solar cells were tested under 1 sun (0.5 AMU) of white light illumination. The largest short circuit current was observed for samples fabricated from spectral hematite. The largest open circuit voltage was observed for hematite films fabricated from spin-coated metal nitrate (Fe(NO3)3)precursors. "
"Reason, Belief, and Ultimate Truth","Johnson, Max; Street, Alexander","A core question of the Carroll Honors Program is defining the search for knowledge and its common end goal; complete knowledge, or “Ultimate Truth.” The program has charted the works of many philosophers, and those who address Ultimate Truth consistently reach very different conclusions about its nature. This much is obvious, but it is less clear what causes these differences. It is often difficult or impossible to find outright errors in the logical processes of these works, certainly not enough to account for the vastness of afore mentioned discrepancies. Upon further inspection, the source of the discrepancy seems to be this: that the logical ladders start with differing assumptions or observations about the nature of humans and the world. If this is true, then it is impossible to separate logic from experience and observations and also impossible to grasp Ultimate Truth with logic alone. Merleau-Ponty expresses a similar sentiment in his World of Perception, arguing that our perception of the world is just as important as sound science in form our understanding of the world. He argues further that this understanding is in fact an approximation, made more or less complete by the breadth or lack thereof of our perception. Immanuel Kant recognizes this in his Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason, arguing for a view of good and evil that also admits an element of spontaneity to human nature. This presentation will explore and synthesize these authors’ views on Ultimate Truth. "
Separation and Identification of Surfactants Found in Glyphosate-Based Herbicides,"Olson, Ryan; Carpenter, Chrissie","In recent years, Roundup and other glyphosate-based herbicides have shown correlation to causing non-Hodgkin lymphoma in humans. However, carcinogenic studies of the active ingredient in these herbicides, glyphosate, report that there is no link between glyphosate exposure and cancer. Therefore, studies are now shifting the focus on a separate series of chemicals that function as dispersal agents for the glyphosate compounds, called surfactants, since these compounds have been shown to be more carcinogenic than the glyphosate itself. In this project, we propose a method to separate and isolate compounds found in store-bought herbicides using a technique called high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Using this technique, we seek to develop an automated method which will isolate and separate our target compounds from a commercial sample of pesticides to better characterize these compounds and provide a starting point for future synthesis. Ultimately, we hope to use this data to synthesize new and less toxic surfactants made from natural and renewable sources. "
Synthesis of 3-oxyangeloyl Trematone,"Dailey, Orrin; Pharr, Caroline","The natural product 3-oxyangeloyl-tremetone has been found to be a potent analgesic. Analgesic compounds have pain killing properties, and are widely used in pain management. This compound can be found in the plant Parastephia lepidophylla in Chile. Extraction of natural products can be expensive and time consuming and is not feasible for large scale production of pharmaceuticals. As a result, a five step synthesis to form the compound of interest from cost effective and readily available starting materials has been proposed. Starting with anisole and acetyl chloride, a Friedel-Crafts acylation was performed. This first step has been completed and the product has been isolated and purified. Synthesis of the next intermediate molecule, from step two, is underway. "
Characterization of Urinary Metabolic Biomarkers of Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD): A Pilot Study,"Bergstrom, Annika; Glimm, Matthew; Houske, Eden; Welhaven, Hope; June, Ronald; Hahn, Alyssa; Hahn, Alyssa","Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most common heritable kidney disease. ADPKD results from a mutation in the genes (PKD1, PKD2) for the mechanosensitive proteins polycystin-1 (PC1) or polycystin-2 (PC2). There is a need for earlier diagnosis of ADPKD so that treatments can be administered to slow or halt the progression of disease. We successfully employed a LC-MS-based global metabolomic profiling approach to 95 human urine samples (48 early ADPKD, 47 control) using an optimized metabolite extraction protocol for urine in search of metabolic biomarkers. A total of 1554 metabolite features were detected across 95 urine samples. We detected differences in global metabolomic profiles between early ADPKD and control samples using orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), a supervised multivariate statistical method that searches for underlying variation between and within groups. 50 metabolites were detected as discriminatory metabolites (biomarkers) between control and ADPKD cohorts. Importantly, creatinine was detected as a potential biomarker, which supports the use of this LC-MS-based global metabolomic approach and provides preliminary insight into a panel of potential biomarkers of early ADPKD detected in human urine. Urine samples were obtained with partial clinical data, including Irazabal classification (1A-1E), which scores ADPKD patients based on disease severity and rate of renal disease progression. OPLS-DA revealed some separation between Irazabal subclasses, with the predictive component scores increasing overall with Irazabal classifications. These results suggest that distinct metabolic phenotypes of ADPKD exist, which correlate with disease severity and rate of disease progression and may have unique metabolic biomarkers. "
Photolytic Studies of Malonate Carbene Intermediates,"Keck, Matt; Pharr, Caroline","Carbene intermediates are of unique interest because of the prevalence of these molecules in interstellar space. These reactive organic intermediates are comprised of a central carbon atom with two bonds and one lone pair of electrons, and they react rapidly under standard temperatures and pressure conditions. The study of these compounds can provide researchers with information about the formation of more complicated molecules in the universe. The primary focus of this study was to conduct trapping experiments using light energy to form a carbene intermediate from a more stable precursor molecule. A trapping agent is added to the solution and reacts immediately with the unstable carbene intermediate when it is formed. The resulting products of this reaction can then be analyzed to provide information about the mechanism of formation of these products. Preliminary data from the reaction of these carbene intermediate compounds with methanol indicate a reaction with the carbene intermediate. "
Study of the Reactivity of Malonate Carbene Derivatives.,"Hendrickson, Roman; Pharr, Caroline","Carbenes are a class of radical organic reactive intermediate used throughout the chemical industry for the formation of carbon-carbon bonds. This chemistry is important for the synthesis of polymers, pharmaceuticals, and other molecules of interest. Carbenes can also be found in interstellar space. Because of their reactivity, it was discovered that when carbenes reacted with water and a base, they can form a sugar. This discovery lends great support to the Primordial Soup Theory of Life’s origin. Carbenes consist of a central carbon atom with two bonds and two free electrons. The electronic configuration of the carbene is referred to as a singlet or triplet state, describing the pairing and placement of the electrons in the unbound orbitals of the carbon atom. These differing electronic configurations yield different reactivities. Synthesis of carbenes using stable precursors allows for the study of their physical and electronic properties. "
Effects of Medical Cannabis on Advanced Cancer Pain,"Frati, Shannon; Dowdy, Josie; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","Cancer is a disease that impacts people from all walks of life, and most patients experience some form of pain with their diagnosis. Pain can be related to their cancer or the treatment of their disease. According to the National Cancer Institute, 20% to 50% of patients with cancer experience pain and in patients with advanced-stage cancer, 80% of patients experience moderate to severe pain (2021). In order to improve the quality of life of patients living with advanced cancer, their pain needs to be managed. According to the American Cancer Society, “advanced cancer” describes cancer that is incurable. Patients with advanced cancer have varying levels of pain dependent on the type of cancer and is based on the individual’s perception (2020). Medical cannabis is one alternative therapy being used to help treat pain and other symptoms of certain medical conditions (Mayo Clinic Staff, 2021). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to examine pain management of cancer patients using medical cannabis. Nurses or other healthcare providers can use this information to educate patients on alternative pain management therapies. "
Stereoselective Synthesis of [Cp*Ru(n 6 -arene)]X Complexes,"Christensen, Logan; Keck, Matt; Schuh, Logan; Hendrickson, Roman; Carpenter, Chrissie; Hitt, David","The creation of 1,2,3,4,5-pentamethylcyclopentadiene, otherwise known as Cp*, is a primary goal. This molecule is very expensive commercially, and a more affordable synthetic route would be beneficial. This research has historically been hindered in the initial stages of Cp* synthesis. An alternate synthetic route with additional purification has allowed the research to progress further. With these new breakthroughs, the research will turn towards the synthesis of ruthenium sandwich complexes and their potential applications. Two examples of these applications is in the field of therapeutics and organic synthesis. "
Quality of Life in People with Hydrocephalus,"Davis, Chloe; Morrison, Logan; Burkholder, Stephanie; Kukulski, Melissa","Hydrocephalus is a condition in which there is a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the ventricles of the brain. Affecting one in five hundred people annually worldwide, it is the most common pediatric neurological surgical condition (Lim et al., 2018). Despite the frequency, there is no cure and the only treatment requires brain surgery. These procedures can cost tens of thousands of dollars each and they likely need more than one revision over time to replace the devices used to treat hydrocephalus (Lim et al., 2018).Given that the treatment of hydrocephalus is likely to come with substantial financial concerns, the goal of this evidenced-based practice review is to determine the relationship between socioeconomic status and quality of life in patients with hydrocephalus. Socioeconomic status is defined in this review as a combination of financial status, education, and occupation that define social standing (American Psychological Association, n.d.). On the other hand, quality of life is defined as a subjective appraisal that identifies the positive and negative outlooks on life (CDC, 2018). Nurses and other healthcare professionals can use the information from this review to ensure all patients have access to the care and education they need in order to mitigate adverse outcomes of this diagnosis and to provide the necessary support and resources to improve quality of life.

Hippotherapy as a Treatment Tool,"Becker, Kaylyn; Suthers, Marie","What is Hippotherapy? The professional treatment utilizing the horse, its movement, therapy activities and the natural environment to meet discipline-specific therapy goals. Currently offered by licensed occupational therapists, physical therapists, or speech therapists. What is the purpose of bringing horses into the rehabilitation process of physical therapy? Some may say it’s a fantasy for horse-crazy folks to live out their desires. Hippotherapy is not only a functional and realistic tool in the operations of rehabilitation and physical therapy, but it in fact, improves the process for patients and therapists in both experience and efficiency. The treatment sessions astride a horse offer a greater stimulatory and motivational environment for disabled peoples in both a physical and psychological realm. In addition, it provides an environment that will keep patients coming back for their therapy sessions with vigor, rather than treating it as a chore. Half of the improvements made in physical therapy are up to the willingness and application of the patient to pursue self-betterment. Research included will be pulled from “Enhancing Human Occupation Through Hippotherapy: A Guide for Occupational Therapy, 1st Edition, 2007.” Written by Barbara T. Engel and Joyce R. MacKinnon, with a PhD, OT, OTR and is a professor at the School of Occupational Therapy, University of Western Ontario. Research will also include information from a series of Hippotherapy books called The Brown Pony Series presented to and surveyed by the AHA national conference for the past 6 years by Rebecca Cook – a Hippotherapy Clinical Specialist with 20 years of private practice experience successfully combining both horses and people in therapy. The conclusive purpose of this research is to bring to light the evidence as well as the proper terminology in practice so to spread awareness of Hippotherapy as a legitimate tool for Physical therapists, Occupational therapists, and Speech Therapists in the state of Montana.

Bystander Intervention Training: Does It Really Work?,"Otis, Landry; Dolan, Jamie; Roncalli, Elvira","American society devalues anything pertaining to the feminine. In particular, our social space promotes a rape culture that objectifies and devalues women, leading to sexual harassment and sexual assaults. Additionally, there is a lack of education regarding sexuality, sexual health, and sexual violence. Sexual assault and sexual violence are prevalent, particularly on college campuses. About 20-25% of female students and 3-6% of male students will experience sexual assault. This research analyzes information that is required/provided on college campuses regarding sexual assault and any bystander training it provides. According to the Campus Climate Survey data, 9% of Carroll students thought the information provided to them was “helpful,” and 44% of respondents reported that it was “slightly helpful.” Similar results were found when asked how well they remember the information given to them, or where to find help should an assault occur. This trend follows other institutions like Carroll. Therefore, researching what other information can be given to students that yields better results can aid Carroll in their information regarding sexual assault. It is essential to build a community that is aware of these sexual violence issues. It must be able to educate its students on what it is, how to prevent it, and to support those who have been victimized. “Our common identities and heritage as women can provide enormous personal and political strength as long as we claim the power to define what women can be and what female institutions can achieve” (Friedman 1995, p. 99).

Characterization of metabolomic profiles in late and early Osteoarthritis patients,"Zebarth, Dawson; Sargent, Arianah; Hahn, Alyssa","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent disease in our society. However, a deep clinical understanding of this metabolic disease remains elusive due to the stratified nature of OA patients. Osteoarthritis presents differently in acute (no prior history of joint disease) and chronic (history of joint disease) patients. Recent studies suggest that chronic versus acute biofluids differ in the Glycine-Serine (Gly-Ser) and collagen breakdown pathways. Further investigation found that patients with a previous OA diagnosis show metabolic profiles more similar to healthy profiles as compared to acute profiels. While many studies have analyzed groupings of chronic/healthy and acute/chronic patients, few studies have compared all three groups. In order for these comparisons to be made, synovial fluid samples from chronic, acute, and healthy patients will be acquired and analyzed using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS). Raw data collected from LC-MS will then be analyzed with Principal Component Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis to determine if groups naturally cluster together. Subsequently, Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis will be used to identify metabolites that discriminate between cohorts. Metabolites with the highest discriminatory power (as determined by variable importance in projection scores) will be analyzed by pathway enrichment algorithms to identify perturbed metabolic pathways in acute versus chronic OA. Different metabolite profiles are expected for the three different groups with the acute patients as an outlier and the chronic patients relating closer to healthy patients. Acute patients should show distinct differences in the Gly-Ser pathway and collagen degradation pathway, while chronic patients should more closely resemble healthy patients. These discoveries could be used to address the heterogeneity of OA and would likely prove beneficial in the development of personalized treatment methods. "
Spatial-temporal analysis on distribution and abundance of Missouri River fish from 2001-2021 seining data,"Hagengruber, Joseph; Hokit, Grant","Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks and Northwestern Energy have conducted seining fisheries surveys on the Missouri River from 2001 to 2021, to determine the abundance and distribution of fishes that reside between five sampling transects along the river. These locations include Morony dam, Fort Benton, Coal Banks, Judith Landing, and Fred Robinson bridge. There haven’t been significant efforts to examine and interpret the large dataset. My project aims to establish and spatial and temporal analysis of relationships between the diversity and abundance of species, and environmental factors such as water temperature, discharge, and Secchi depth readings. The intent of the project is to provide an analysis that demonstrates an association between biological and environmental variables. The project is not a controlled experiment, so the results displayed do not indicate causation. Through this study and the results, I hope to provide ideas for future management of non-game and prairie fish, especially for species that are listed as species of concern. "
Hezbollah: Party of God,"Webb, McCabe; Fregulia, Jeanette","It is difficult to think of a group whose goals and actions resist a simple characterization more than that of the Lebanon-based “Hezbollah” (Hizbulla, Hizballah). Viewed by some as protectors and others as a threat, this organization connotes a wide variety of things to many different people globally. This presentation endeavors to express the history of the organization, including the reason behind its formation, its goals, and the roles it has had and continues to play in society. This presentation takes a nuanced approach, presenting a variety of perspectives on an organization which cannot be generalized. Finally, this work addresses the role Hezbollah plays in security as both a potential partner and possible concern for various parties both locally and internationally. "
Applying Global Metabolomics to Investigate the Correlation Between BMI and Osteoarthritis,"Payne, McKenna; Mozer, Aiden; Hahn, Alyssa","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease characterized by the progressive breakdown of articular cartilage. One of the significant and modifiable risk factors for developing OA is obesity. There is still much to learn about the cellular mechanisms of OA, and diagnosis is limited to identifying structural damage within the joint. New studies in the field of metabolomics have shown promise in identifying biomarkers that could lead to early diagnosis, monitoring of the disease, and understanding of the pathophysiology of OA. In this research study, synovial fluid (SF) samples were analyzed through global metabolomics to study the effects of body mass index (BMI) on the development of osteoarthritis. The samples were collected from a local clinic in Helena, and metabolites will be extracted from the samples. Extracted metabolites will be analyzed through liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) in order to assign mass values to each individual metabolite. Statistical and functional analyses will be performed to identify metabolic trends in order to elucidate the relationship between BMI and OA to better understand BMI as a risk factor for developing OA.

"Nanopore Sequencing of Microbial Communities from the Asarco East Helena, Montana Smelter Site","Shefelbine, Lucas; McWade, Molly; Lohr, Kelsyn; Schultz, Brooklynn; Beck, Ashley","Lead pollution has extremely negative effects on both the environment and the organisms living in it. The work done in this project serves to demonstrate the effects of the East Helena smelting operation on the microbiome of the soil in the area, as well as the effects of subsequent soil remediation efforts. The smelting operation and its pollutants have drastically impacted the area, as seen by the EPA’s designation of the area as a Superfund site. We hypothesized that the soil’s microbiome has been affected as well, both in species variation and population. Soil samples were procured from different locations around the East Helena smelter site varying in remediation levels. Microbial DNA was extracted from the samples, and a Nanopore sequencer was used to sequence the DNA and identify the microbial taxa present in each sample. From an analysis of the microbial community composition data, we were able to understand the patterns of different species and populations present in the soil. By gathering soil samples and microbiome data from locations at various positions and stages of remediation around the smelting site, the goal was to determine the impacts of both pollution and soil remediation on the microbiome of the area.

"Why Our Education Is “Not for School, but for Life”","Radosevich, Megan; Smillie, Mark","In recent years liberal arts education has faced great resistance on the grounds that this type of education is neither a wise investment nor relevant for modern times. These claims are failing to consider the genuine intrinsic value that transcends these worries. For this presentation I will defend a liberal arts education and argue that the benefit of obtaining a liberal arts education holds comprehensive value for all members of society. My research includes the thoughts of figures such as Aristotle, Cardinal John Henry Newman, and other modern and contemporary sources. This presentation provides a brief history of the liberal arts, outlines the purpose of a liberal arts education, and responds to a modern critique from Jean-Jacques Rousseau alongside other contemporary critiques of the value of this education.

"Discovering Potential Biomarkers for Osteoarthritis, Gouty Arthritis, and Rheumatoid Arthritis","McCleary, Haily; Stevens, Ellie; Hahn, Alyssa","In the United States alone, 24% of adults have arthritis, which include many different types. The three most common forms of arthritis are osteoarthritis (OA), gouty arthritis (gout), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Despite having different pathologies, the main symptoms of all types include pain, aching, stiffness, and swelling of joints. There are no cures for OA, gout, or RA, so treatment is based on symptom management, with more targeted and beneficial treatment being introduced early into disease progression. The diagnostic process for all three disease states is complex, and there is a need to find effective diagnostic markers for early detection. This research examines the use of metabolomics to analyze metabolite levels and intermediates in metabolic pathways in order to find potential biomarkers indicative of their respective disease and provide early and more concise diagnosis. In our experiment, we will extract metabolites from synovial fluid samples and analyze them using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry to identify possible biomarkers that would help early diagnosis of arthritis. After metabolite extraction, the raw data will be analyzed using the online data analysis site Metaboanalyst. Using Metaboanalyst. We will construct multiple statistical plots to compare osteoarthritis, gouty arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis on a molecular level. Our goal is to find unique metabolic pathways affected by each type of arthritis, and to confirm potential biomarkers that could help diagnose each type of arthritis earlier. We hypothesize that rheumatoid arthritis will appear the most different due to the role the immune system plays, but ultimately, we expect to see unique metabolites and affected metabolic pathways in each type of arthritis.

The Role of Sex Education in Victim Blaming,"Holmes, Bray; Dolan, Jamie; Roncalli, Elvira","Throughout different parts of the United States, there is a large variety of sex education. It can range from abstinence to full comprehensive plus sex education. A major downfall for the majority of the sex education tactics used in the United States is failing to discuss consent and open communication, two things that are important in every other aspect of our lives. A recent study from Missouri State (May 2021) may suggest that abstinence sex education may result in more judgemental views on victim-blaming and rape culture. It is important to learn the most effective way for sex education to reduce the amount of stigma around the topic. Through this research, I have identified ways that Carroll College can educate and progress on this issue as well as looked at literature from feminist authors to gain insight on possible solutions.

Metabolic Profiles of Synovial Fluid and Platelet-Poor Plasma by Osteoarthritic Grade,"Houske, Eden; Marcham, Michael; Hahn, Alyssa","Osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic degenerative synovial joint and bone disease characterized by articular cartilage degradation and affecting nearly 654.1 million adults worldwide. It is currently diagnosed and graded using radiologic imaging, which primarily relies on physicians' subjective interpretations of the radiographs. This is at times inconsistent across the medical field and proves problematic in accurately assessing the state of disease. The primary aim of this study is to compare the metabolic profiles of synovial fluid (SF) and platelet poor plasma across different grades of OA in order to identify biomarkers that can be used to accurately ascertain the severity of OA. Understanding how local (SF) and systemic (blood plasma) responses to stress vary on a metabolic level could aid in developing a form of plasma based diagnosis that is more objective than radiography and less invasive than acquiring synovial fluid. Detecting biomarkers in blood plasma allows for quick metabolic analysis that can be used to diagnose OA in its earlier stages, leading to a positive patient prognosis. Early and late OA (n=2) synovial fluids will be analyzed by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to measure global metabolic changes. Platelet poor plasma from individuals with early and late OA (n=2) will be assessed as well. Comparisons between early OA (grades II-III), and late OA (grades III+) synovial fluids and blood plasma samples will be analyzed to assess characteristics of each stage of disease progression both locally and systemically.

Postpartum Depression in Black Women: Exploring Health Inequity,"Wieland, Emma; Zike, Mira; Burkholder, Stephanie; Kukulski, Melissa","According to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (2021), racial and ethnic minority groups in the US experience higher rates of illness and death across a wide range of health conditions. More succinctly, some scholars have noted that ""being Black is bad for your health"" (Williams, 2016). Black women are 2 to 3 times as likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause than white women (CDC, 2020). A major maternal concern for Black women is postpartum depression. Postpartum depression affects 1 in 8 women of any race (CDC, 2021). Postpartum depression is a type of depression experienced by the mother after the birth of her child. It is much more severe and lasts longer than the more common “baby blues” (Mayo Clinic, 2018). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to shed light on racial disparities that exist among postpartum depression rates of Black women when compared to women of other races. This problem must be recognized before attempting to discuss how to fix this health disparity. Nurses or other healthcare professionals can use this information to become aware of health inequality between races and potential bias in the healthcare system. By illuminating postpartum depression rates in Black women, nurses will have a better understanding of the gaps in healthcare for people of color and will take into practice the importance of screening all women for postpartum depression.

A Virtue Ethics Argument for Music Education,"Montowski, Claire; Glowienka, Edward","Ethics and music are fields that may appear to have nothing in common, one is involved in the expression of emotion, while the other is ordered towards doing the good. Despite initially seeming very different these fields have been paired together for thousands of years. The ancient philosophers Aristotle and Confucius both saw music as having an important impact on building character. The lead singer of U2, Bono, ostensibly, agrees with these ancient philosophers having once professed, “Music can change the world because it can change people.” However, unlike famous rockstars, more recent philosophers deny music as having the ability to change people, challenging the thoughts of Aristotle, Confucius, and Bono. I argue for the value of music beyond the aesthetic. Using the framework of virtue ethics, I argue that music has value for a musician as learning an instrument increases practical wisdom and helps build the virtue of mildness. "
Developing a New Class of Antibiotics: The Oxadiazoles,"Houske, Eden; Blote, Emily; Doyle, Sophia; Hitt, David","Bacterial antibiotic resistance is a significant issue that has persisted in healthcare due to bacteria's fast mutation rates which constantly drives the need for new therapeutic drugs. This includes the synthesis of novel antibiotics that hold promise in interfering with bacterial mechanisms of resistance (e.g. mutation). Recently, the synthesis of oxadiazole derivatives has been a specific area of interest as these non-B-lactam antibiotics appear to be strong candidates. In 2014, researchers reported a series of 1,2,4-oxadiazole antibiotics that were discovered through in silico screening in which a variety of structures were docked computationally to a protein target associated with bacterial resistance. After an initial oxadiazole structure showed promise, further synthetic refinement of the core structure resulted in a series of active antibiotic compounds of varying substitution. Although numerous candidates have been successfully synthesized previously, there is a lack of derivatives with varying substitution patterns on the phenyl rings, which may prove beneficial to increasing the potency of the oxadiazole-based compounds. Therefore, the aim of this study is to synthesize novel oxadiazole compounds that provide variations on the phenyl rings substituting the 3 and 5 positions of the 1,2,4-oxadiazole ring. These compounds could subsequently be tested for their antibiotic potencies to determine which structures are most effective in preventing bacterial proliferation. Thus far, a reported oxadiazole has been successfully synthesized in our lab, which will serve as a control. To date, several novel oxadiazoles not reported previously are one reaction away from the desired antibiotic form. "
The Analysis of the Ebony Gene in Culex tarsalis Across the Major Drainages of Montana,"Antonioli, Nathaniel; Hokit, David; Otto-Hitt, Stephanie","Many species have natural variations. One of the most obvious is in their color or pigmentation. Culex tarsalis is a vector for the virus known as West Nile Virus. This species of mosquito is found across the state of Montana. The environments that this mosquito inhabits are also quite varied ranging from swamps, wetlands, lakes, and prairie springs. The environments offer various selective pressures that may select for different color variations within the species. To determine if any are distinct, RNA gene templates were extracted from various drainages across the state and were quantified via PCR. The gene being quantified was the ebony gene and the control was the quantification of the actin gene. The values were then normalized and statistical analysis was performed to determine whether or not any of the drainages differed significantly. The significantly different drainages and populations were noted and possible reasons for the differences were explored. These populations may be distinct due to the active selective pressure against other color variations which inhibits gene flow from populations with a different color type. These populations can then be targeted for experiments to determine a more accurate means of observing gene flow for Culex tarsalis across Montana. "
Impact of Seizure Alert Dogs in Epilepsy,"Braden, Bridget; O'Brien, Molly; Bell, Katherine; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","Epilepsy, a seizure disorder, is characterized by a disruption of electrical activity in the brain. Most commonly, epilepsy is diagnosed after a person has two or more seizures (Shafer, 2013). Worldwide 65 million people have epilepsy, 3.4 million of which are in the United States; 150,000 people are added to that number every year (Shafer, 2013). “One-third … of people with epilepsy … live with uncontrollable seizures because no available treatment works for them” (Shafer, 2013). Seizure Alert dogs (SADs) are certified service animals under the federal law that detect when a person is going to have a seizure and notify them before the seizure occurs (Epilepsy Foundation, 2007). The seizure alert dogs can also be trained to assist during and after the seizure by staying “close to their companions for the duration of the seizure, as well as fetch medications, a telephone or caretaker” (Epilepsy Foundation, 2007). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to determine the effectiveness of seizure alert dogs (SAD) in reducing the frequency of seizures in those diagnosed with epilepsy. Healthcare providers can educate patients about alternatives to medical seizure therapy and can advocate for patients to own a SAD to improve patient outcomes and quality of life for patients with epilepsy.

Metabolomic Profile Comparison of Osteoarthritic and Traumatically Injured Synovial Joints,"Nowlen, Maycee; Short, Samantha; Hahn, Alyssa","The widespread prevalence of degenerative joint diseases, such as osteoarthritis, characterized as a leading cause of disability, affects thousands of people around the world. Post-traumatic arthritis is a joint condition following joint injuries such as fractures or dislocations. The risk of developing arthritis is higher for people who have suffered an injury to their joints than for those who have never experienced such an injury. The exact mechanisms causing joint degradation remain unknown. Recent studies have applied metabolomics to the study of OA, and several metabolism-related pathways, as well as specific metabolic markers, have been identified as contributing factors. Although OA and post-traumatic OA are common across the world and have been extensively studied, only a partial understanding exists of the metabolites responsible for both. . In this study, 13 different patients' synovial fluid samples will be collected. Seven contain the osteoarthritis pathology, one is from a joint that has undergone traumatic injury, and five are healthy control samples. By comparing the synovial fluid of the two experimental categories to controls, this study aims to identify possible differences and similarities in metabolite characteristics and populations in the biofluid. A LC-MS analysis will be performed on the samples and metabolite features that distinguish between cohorts will be identified using univariate and multivariate statistical methods. The study will employ pathway enrichment analyses to identify metabolic pathways impacted by injury and osteoarthritis. Biomarkers explored in this research may help diagnose OA and detect early symptoms associated with OA after a traumatic injury. "
Examining Love and Marriage through Their Eyes Were Watching God and The Canterbury Tales,"Williams, Nicole; Street, Alex","Though they were written centuries apart, Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales and Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God share some important insights into the nature of romantic love. In particular, these stories portray the complicated nature of love and marriage in a women’s life. While characters like Hurston’s Janie Crawford and the Wife of Bath desire romance, they also struggle with the constraints that marriage often places on women. The Wife of Bath claims in her prologue that she wishes to have complete control over her husbands, but the theme of her tale seems to expose her desire for romantic love, as well as a (perhaps unconscious) belief that women must submit to the will of their husbands in order to be happy. The role that submission plays in the lives of women is explored in depth in Hurston’s novel, and the protagonist Janie is forced to put aside her own thoughts and desires in order to properly play the role of wife. However, Janie and Teacake’s marriage as well the relationship featured in The Franklin’s Tale showcase relationships in which these issues of autonomy and self actualization, while still somewhat present, are mostly mitigated by a focus on genuine love and connection as well as some form of mutual equality between lovers. This presentation seeks to explore the complex relationship between love and self-actualization, understanding that marriage can often hinder a woman’s autonomy while also acknowledging the important role that romantic connections play in self-fulfillment.

Food Insecurity and Cardiovascular Disease,"Gabocy, Taylor; Ivovic, Kylie; Liday, Sam; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been shown to be more prominent in individuals who are food insecure as compared to those who are food secure (Chang et al., 2021). According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 2021, food insecurity is defined as living without reliable and consistent access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food for every person in a household to live an active, healthy life. This can be a temporary situation for a household or can be continuous throughout the year. More than 38 million people, including 12 million children, experience food insecurity in the United States (Martin, 2021). Mayo Clinic defines heart disease as a range of conditions affecting the heart including blood vessel disease (coronary artery disease), heart rhythm problems, congenital heart defects, heart valve disease, disease of the heart muscle, and heart infection. The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to examine how being food insecure can directly impact the risk of developing or worsening CVD in adults, as compared to individuals who are food secure. Accordingly, “among the 18,442 (8.2%) adults with atherosclerosis [a type of cardiovascular disease], about 1 in 7 reported being food insecure. Adults with atherosclerosis are more likely to earn a low income and experience food insecurity than those without the condition” (Chang et al., 2021). This research is important because CVD affects a significant proportion of the population, and finding ways to decrease the onset and mortality of CVD is key. "
The Effects of Water Fountain Filter Status on Microbial Diversity,"Held, Benjamin; Doyle, Sophia; Durocher, Whitney; Zebarth, Dawson; Beck, Ashley","In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals have become exceedingly health-conscious. When in public, water fountains such as the Elkay ezH2O have allowed accessibility to filtered water that supposedly minimizes harmful pathogens as well as chemicals. The objective of this experiment was to determine whether the color of the filter status on Elkay ezH2O water fountains makes a difference in microbial diversity in drinking water on campus. After collecting water samples from one green filter status (healthy) and four red filter status (needs replacement) fountains across Carroll College campus, the microbial DNA of each sample was extracted and amplified. Additionally, wastewater was used as a control to compare to the water fountain samples. The microbiome of each fountain and the control was analyzed using Nanopore sequencing, which provided an in depth analysis of the community composition present in the water samples. Based on the results of the microbiome, a comparison between the red and green status water fountains was performed to determine the necessity and effectiveness of new filters on the water fountains around Carroll College.

What Can Love Accomplish?: The Constructive and Destructive Impacts of Love on the Self in Their Eyes Were Watching God and King Lear,"Gnoyski, Alyssa; Street, Alex","Their Eyes Were Watching God and King Lear display many different types of love. While King Lear explores familial love, Their Eyes Were Watching God delves into romantic love. As Janie pursues her romantic interests in Their Eyes Were Watching God, she discovers an overwhelming love for Tea Cake. Believing she has reached the realization of her deepest desires, Janie finds herself mistaken when the relationship fails. Yet, in the aftermath, she blossoms into a new individual, at which point she reaches happiness. On the other hand, King Lear follows the gradual deterioration of fathers Lear and Gloucester as their relationships with their children are riddled with betrayal. Disowning the only daughter who loves him and suffering from the traitorous acts of his other two daughters, Lear slowly sinks into madness. Likewise, Gloucester betrays the loving loyalties of his son Edgar in exchange for his manipulative son Edmund and dies as a result of the betrayal. Love and the betrayal of love, as seen within both works, ultimately cause a transformation of the individual. While love achieves individual maturation, it always contains the associated risk of betrayal, which (if strong enough) brings about the opposite effect. In Janie’s case, relational love functions as a rebirth and serves to accomplish personal growth; yet, for Lear and Gloucester, relational love is largely synonymous with destruction, for the betrayals that arise from their loving relations override the love doted upon them and break them down until there is nothing left.

"The ""Othering"": The Impact of Societal Normativity on Exclusion and Oppression","Neuhaus, Katelyn; Dolan, Jamie; Roncalli, Elvira","In many places around the world where there has been an interest in studying women and gender roles, including in the United States, there has been a concerted effort to withdraw support for continued research and eliminate Gender Studies altogether. Tensions are on the rise and violence is breaking out as many religious and conservative factions are fighting abolish civil rights, reproductive and bodily autonomy rights for women, the rights of LGBTQ+ persons, robust and relevant public education where it differs from conservative–often religiously–based ideology especially on topics of ethnic studies and sexual education, and any other topic considered taboo by the vocal minority. The current social climate perpetuates societal “othering”, widening the gap between social groups. There exists division between those who are fighting to maintain patriarchal order, in which traditional gender roles are protected and alternative lifestyles are viewed as a threat to the natural order, and those who promote inclusivity and equal rights. My goal with this SURF project is to consider the impact of societal normativity and political and religious beliefs in the creation of an “othering” as it relates to the perpetuation of a climate of exclusion and oppression. I will incorporate personal experiences, including my own familial story and the impact of societal norms and opinions that create a climate of exclusion and oppression. I will consider the works of Simone De Beauvior, Adriene Rich, Judith Butler and Bell Hooks, in addition to outside sources and my personal testimony. "
Education for Healthcare Professionals on Screening for Child Abuse,"Russell, Anna; McCarthy, Taya; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","Child abuse and maltreatment affect approximately 1 in 7 children across the United States which, according to the CDC, is likely an underestimate (CDC, 2021). Child maltreatment can include physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as neglect. Neglect is defined as “failure to meet a child’s basic physical and emotional needs,” such as, housing, food, and access to medical care (CDC, 2021). These adverse childhood experiences do not only have immediate physical effects, but long term psychological and emotional effects such as depression, attention deficit disorder, and drug and alcohol use (Dinpanah & Akbarzadeh Pasha, 2017). Consistent screening for child abuse is imperative to ensure early identification. Insufficient knowledge of injuries consistent with abuse, lack of a standardized screening protocol, and impaired confidence in administering screening tools lead to healthcare providers simply not performing screenings. Research shows that “if abuse goes undetected at the initial presentation, the abused child has a 35% to 50% chance of experiencing recurrent abuse and a 10% to 30% chance of eventual death from that abuse” (Carson, 2018, p. 577). The purpose of this evidence based review is to examine the relationship between education for healthcare professionals about screening for child abuse and how it improves their confidence in performing the screening. Nurses and other healthcare professionals are mandatory reporters, so education on performing screenings and detecting child abuse is necessary for protecting these vulnerable populations. "

Improving City of Helena Time Leave Process,"Rodriguez, Javier; Merz, Matthew; Long, Karissa; Bloy, Rory; Lynch, Hunter; Todd, John; Dimian, Adel","The City of Helena is struggling with timesheet management issues as it deals with the complexity of city policy and governance. Our team is using Six Sigma Methodology to understand the core variables in their leave tracking process that lead to negative outcomes, such as incorrect payroll and unrecorded leave. Specifically, we use the D-M-A-I-C stages of Six Sigma process improvement to identify the key variables that drive HR and payroll performance. The team applies statistical analysis to these critical variables to prove significance and impact of the ones that contribute the most to the problem faced, thus allowing improvement ideas to be targeted, measured, and controlled. By using the Six Sigma methodology, the team expects to significantly reduce the costs that the city of Helena faces in terms of time and resources not efficiently allocated. "
The Possibility of Improvement of the Human Condition: Exploring the Works of Karl Marx and T. S. Eliot,"Rodriguez, Javier; Street, Alex","In this presentation, I will explore two different views about the concept of progress to define the role of progress and find what is the most appropriate approach of progress for humans. Karl Marx explains in The Communist Manifesto that progress is reached through class struggle, just like everything else regarding social issues has changed throughout human history. T.S. Eliot in his poem The Waste Land goes another direction, approaching the degradation of human condition after WWI, and although progress is not explicitly mentioned in the poem, the effects of the ruthless pursuit of it can be perceived. While both authors acknowledge that there can be setbacks and even regression instead of progress, they differ on the possibility of positive outcomes in the human pursuit of progress. Marx envisions a future with endless possibilities to those proletarians that join the class struggle to progress in their rights. On the other hand, Eliot has a much more pessimistic approach of any human quest for significant improvement on any area. The relevance of this topic is on the fact that there might be a possible equilibrium that allows humanity to continue our quest for progress safely with a minimal amount of risk taken in the fact that a certain invention can be used for evil instead of good.

Quality of Life in Organ Transplant Patients,"Conrad, Hannah; Groshong, Olivia; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","Solid organ transplants (SOT) are often the only life saving or quality of life (QOL)-improvement measures that can be taken for patients with end-stage diseases. According to the National Council for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), a solid organ transplant is defined as “a treatment, not a cure, for end-stage organ failure of the kidney, liver, pancreas, heart, and lung” (2018). The World Health Organization (WHO) defines QOL as ""an individual's perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns” (2022). The purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to examine the relationship between SOT and QOL in transplant patients. Nurses or other healthcare providers can use this information to provide more competent and holistic care for this vulnerable patient population. "
Optimization of Lactose-Functionalized Poly(amidoamine) Dendrimer Synthesis,"Field, Cameren; Cloninger, Mary","Glycopolymers have been previously shown to regulate multivalent galectin-3 mediated processes in cancer progression including in vitro homotypic cancer cellular aggregation/tumor formation, cancer cellular migration, angiogenesis, proliferation, and apoptosis. The objective of this research is to develop multivalent synthetic frameworks that bind to galectin-3 and inhibit its anti-apoptotic biochemical pathway in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cell lines, thus preventing platinum chemotherapy agent resistance. Herein is the reported data for designing a high-yielding synthesis of lactose-functionalized poly(amidoamine) dendrimers (PAMAMs), which are intended to effectively bind to galectin-3, and thereby allow platinum-induced apoptosis. The target lactose functionalized PAMAM has been synthesized. ¹H NMR spectral data for synthetic intermediates for progress toward the target carbohydrate molecule confirm the success of the reaction pathway. Efficacy of the lactose functionalized PAMAMs is currently being tested in cell-based assays. "
Stem Cell Therapy for Treatment of Lower Back Pain Due to Degenerative Disk Disease: A Systematic Review,"Stigen, Tristan; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature concerning the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for individuals that suffer from lower back pain (LBP) due to degenerative disc disease (DDD). Methods: The literature for this systematic review was gathered through PubMed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar. All articles were assessed for the effectiveness of stem cell therapy for individuals with LBP due to DDD. Results: Most participants in the five studies using stem cell therapy on humans saw favorable results that included improvements in pain, quality of life, range of motion, and decrease in disc provocation. The other two studies involving rabbits showed favorable results for the success that stem cells had in cell fusion as well as improvement in degenerated intervertebral discs (IVD). Conclusions: The use of stem cell therapy showed improvement in patients that suffer from LBP due to DDD. MeSH keywords: stem cell therapy; degenerative disc disease; lower back pain. "
How To Support a Survivor,"Graham, Sarah; Lundberg, Madison; Cherry, Tarryn; Lynch, Mara; Rausch, Emma; Phillip, Henry; Nouh, Ibrahim; Parsley, Kelly","Sexual assaults happen on every college campus; however despitehigh occurrences, reporting rates assaults are relatively low. “studies have found that only 0% to 5.3% survivors made a formal grievance through university reporting procedures (Fisher et al., 2003; Lindquist et al., 2013). Similarly, 0% to 17.8% of survivors sought help from SACs or women’s centers on campus (Krebs, Lindquist, Warner, Fisher & Martin, 2007; Nasta et al., 2005; Wolitzky-Taylor et al., 2011).” (Holland & Cortina. page 51). Survivors shared four reasons for not reporting: 1. a lack of resources in one’s community; 2. affordability included the costs of care. 3. accessibility barriers occurred when reporting options and/or resources were available, but survivors could not use them (e.g., lack time or transportation) or did not know enough to use them; 4. acceptability or feelings, beliefs, and responses that made it feel as if it was unacceptable to use supports, (e.g., feelings of embarrassment, shame, and self-blame, fearing backlash from their community, worrying about confidentiality). (Holland & Cortina. page 52). Students in Public Health Practice and Theories (PH333) began work to ensure survivors at Carroll felt more supported. They completed an academic literature reveiw on how peer support can help a survivor of sexual assault, harassment, and discrimination. In addition, they conducted 13 interviews of Carroll Students, two focus groups, and environmental scans of the Carroll College Website and of the app called Reach out Editions to scan for usability, accuracy, and Catholic appropriateness.

The Effect of Music Therapy on Cancer Pain,"Bennett, Elizabeth; Resch, Jacob; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","Every year, 1.6 million people are diagnosed with cancer in the United States (National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion, 2020). Cancer is known to cause immense pain in patients which can be detrimental to their quality of life. “Fifty percent of all cancer patients suffer pain…75% among those with advanced cancer” (Fernando et al., 2019) .Long term impacts on mood, mental health, cognitive processes, and physical functioning can result from inadequately treated pain (American Music Therapy Association, 2005). Cancer can occur almost anywhere in the body and is a disease of the genes in cells of our body (National Cancer Institute, 2021). Cancer is a chronic disease which results in pain for long periods of time. Music therapy uses interventions such as listening to live music, music-associated relaxation, music-guided imagery, singing and chanting, songwriting, and instrument playing to relieve pain (American Music Therapy Association, 2005). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Brief is to examine the use of music therapy for pain management in cancer patients. The use of music therapy will be compared with the results of those not using music therapy for pain control. Nurses have the responsibility to utilize all possible interventions in order to alleviate the pain of their patients. Pain is often not reduced by pharmacological interventions alone, and nonpharmacological interventions are useful in providing holistic care. Nurses can use this information to advocate for their patients and implement the use of different intervention for pain control. "

Results: The majority of the literature supported the use of OMT for reducing the prevalence and intensity of multiple headache disorders. Conclusion: OMT interventions show promising results for patients who struggle with headache disorders, in terms of increasing quality of life, and reducing the amount of time with pain. "
Artificial Nipple Use and Breastfeeding Patterns,"Portmann, Grace; Cooney, Jill; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2021) identifies that “One of the most highly effective preventive measures a mother can take to protect the health of her infant is to breastfeed.” Infants who are breastfed are seen to have a lower risk of developing many conditions later in life including asthma, obesity, type I diabetes, and ear infections to name just a few (CDC, 2021). The mother also receives benefits as well such as lower rates of some cancers. Acknowledging the benefits that breastfeeding offers both the infant and the mother, it can be understood why it is imperative that it is established and maintained following birth when possible. The World Health Organization recommends that infants are exclusively breastfed for 6 months and then continued to be breastfed for up to 2 years with complementary foods (2022); however, many factors contribute to the success of breastfeeding, with one factor in particular that has been associated with potentially having an influence on how well infants continue to breastfeed. That factor is the use of artificial nipples. In this case, artificial nipples refer to pacifiers or bottles used throughout infancy. The purpose of this review is to determine whether artificial nipple use in infancy truly has a significant influence on an infant’s breastfeeding patterns. Nurses can use the information gathered from this review to educate mothers on the use of artificial nipples. Mothers and caregivers can then be more informed on whether or not to introduce their infant to products such as bottles or pacifiers. "
The Will to Change: Understanding the Political Conversion of Benito Mussolini,"Bills, Shae; Pavlakis, Dean","The fascist Duce, Benito Mussolini, is well known for his role as Dictator of Italy and for his alliance with Nazi Germany during World War Two. However, Mussolini was once a poor young boy who lived in a small Italian village with his Catholic mother and socialist revolutionary father. In his young adult years he adopted many of the socialist beliefs of his father and began his political career as a journalist and editor for several socialist newspapers. Then the catastrophe struck with the First World War and Mussolini was expelled from the socialist party for his pro-war political position. In 1919, Mussolini formed the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento and began to gain support from nationalists across Italy seeking political stability and control. Then, in 1922 Mussolini and his fascist party took over the Italian government during their March on Rome, thus beginning the two decade rule of the Duce. In this presentation I will be sharing my research on why Mussolini transformed from an avid socialist into the leader of the fascist movement, effectively shifting from the radical left to the radical right in a matter of years.

Hormonal Contraceptives and the Risk of Breast Cancer,"Putnam, Emma; Hoke, Kylee; Burkholder, Stephanie; Kukulski, Melissa","A diagnosis of breast cancer (BC) is a scary event in one’s life, leading many with the diagnosis to examine their previous and current risk factors for the disease. Given the wide use of hormonal contraceptives (HC) by women, the link between the use of HC has been studied as a possible risk factor in the development of BC. In the United States, there are more than 3.8 million women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer (American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2021). The National Cancer Institute identifies BC as the number one cancer diagnosed in women (2020). BC has the potential to not only affect breast tissue, but to alter a woman's self-concept and quality of life. HCs can be administered in a variety of routes and work by altering the female’s ovulation and menstrual cycles. Each type of HC presents different benefits/risks to consumers. The purpose of this Evidence Based Practice Review is to examine published literature regarding HCs in women of childbearing age and their risk of developing BC. Women who use HCs will be compared to those who don’t, to determine this potential risk. Healthcare providers can use this information to encourage or discourage the use of HCs, or alter HC education to patients. If there is a link between the use of HCs and the development of BC, the relationship must be understood to inform users of HCs about the risk and to ensure women are properly screened for the disease.

Insects of the Sevenmile Creek Restoration Site: More Than Yellowjackets and Mosquitoes,"Sater, Shane; Hokit, Grant","Insects play an incredible variety of essential roles in all ecological systems. However, they are often underappreciated and poorly known by the public, except for the handful of species that regularly conflict with humans, such as yellowjackets and mosquitoes. Meanwhile, several recent studies suggest that we may be rapidly losing insect biodiversity worldwide. Between 2017 and 2022 I observed and identified 192+ species of insects on the Sevenmile Creek restoration site near Helena, Montana and reviewed the literature for life history information about each. Here I share a selection of some of the most fascinating insects I encountered during my research. "
Modeling Maize Root-Associated Bacterial Interactions,"Phillip, Henry; Beck, Ashley","A commonly unknown contributor toward plant growth is the microbial community that exists within the soil. The microbial community is composed of bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and archaea. The interaction between members of the microbial community and the associated plant is not clearly understood. In this study, seven key bacteria associated with the maize plant root were used to begin understanding and predicting potential interactions using KBase, a biological computation modeling program. Individual models of the metabolism of each bacterial species were created using their sequenced genome along with a designed nutrient medium, followed by the creation of two and three member community models. Each model was analyzed using flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming algorithm that optimizes the bacterial metabolic process for a specific objective such as biomass optimization. FBA simulations developed a complex nutrient exchange (amino acids, carbon sources, and vitamins) prediction that was used to create maps to simplify the interpretation of bacterial interactions. Collaborators at North Carolina State University use the models to improve the design of experimental trials and increase the rate of discovery. Improved understanding of the interaction between the microbial community and the plant can benefit agricultural production efficiency. "
Heparin Treatment for Pregnant Women with Protein S Deficiency: A Systematic Review,"Cook, Breanna; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of heparin for decreasing adverse pregnancy outcomes in women diagnosed with thrombophilia disorders, with an emphasis on protein S deficiency. Methods: Literature was gathered using PubMed and CINAHL databases on the effectiveness of heparin on protein S deficiency during pregnancy. Results: Most studies supported heparin as an effective intervention for preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes. One study showed no significant difference when heparin was compared to aspirin as an intervention. Conclusion: Heparin is promising as an intervention for PS deficiency and other thrombophilia in pregnant women. Heparin and other interventions should be researched further as treatment options to protect the mother and fetus in a hypercoagulable state. "
Set: A Board Game Presentation,"Grende, Rakiah; Fasteen, Jodi","Set is a logic card game consisting of 81 unique cards where the players build sets based on colors, shapes, and other attributes. The original game has 1080 possible sets that can be built. Several questions were asked about how to alter the way the game is played to make it harder. Some questions include: how many sets were possible if another attribute was appended to the game, if another kind of color, shape, fill, or number was added, or if the game was played with more than one deck? One of the most interesting questions: is there an efficient algorithm that can be used to find a set? This project explored various sub-topics of statistics and discrete math. "
Treatments for Post-Concussion Syndrome: A Systematic Review,"Conway, Sarah; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature regarding interventions for post-concussive symptoms after experiencing mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methods: Literature gathered through CINAHL and PubMed was assessed for the effectiveness of treatments for post-concussive symptoms. Results: Most of the literature provided evidence that the treatments under evaluation were effective in reducing post-concussive symptoms. Two repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation studies showed increased speed of recovery as well as symptom relief. Hyperbaric oxygen was the only treatment that did not have sufficient evidence of symptom relief. Conclusions: Post-concussive symptoms from mTBI can be treated in multiple ways. The most researched and supported new treatment is rTMS. However, all treatments in this review should be further researched to provide better information on efficacy. "
"Anxiety, Workload, and Social Support in College Students","Ehl, Megan; Raffa, Luke; Nelson, Alyssa; Low, Ellie; Roghi, Katie; Honzel, Nikki","Previous studies have indicated that college students with higher levels of perceived social support also reported lower levels of anxiety (Li et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2013). Additionally, research supports that high levels of perceived workload was associated with an individual’s perception of anxiety (Kiziela et al., 2019 & Mboya et al., 2020). The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between anxiety, workload, and social support in college students. The participants consisted of students from the General Psychology course at Carroll College. The participants were asked to complete the Participant Demographic Questionnaire (PDQ), the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), the Subjective Workload Questionnaire (SWQ), and the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (shortened version; ISEL-sv). The results of our study reflected that anxiety was a significant negative correlation with social support (r = -0.521, p=0.009). Additionally, we found a significant positive correlation between social support and the number of credits the participant was enrolled in. These results support previous research that when students feel socially supported they also feel less anxious (Li et al., 2021; Özmete & Pak, 2020; Zhou et al., 2013). Previous studies have indicated that college students with higher levels of perceived social support also reported lower levels of anxiety (Li et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2013).

Preventative Care Visits of Adolescents and Health Behaviors,"Larson, Elizabeth; Kukulski, Melissa","The adolescent population has increased rates of health issues, which can be carried into adulthood. Health issues that are often preventable include diabetes, high blood pressure, being overweight or underweight, and high cholesterol. Health behaviors provide information about the patient’s lifestyle, such as social behaviors, tobacco and alcohol use, sexual health, diet, physical activity, emotional health, and academic functioning. If the number of young people developing health issues is growing, these health issues will impact our families, communities, and the workforce. Consequently, the population of 10- to 18-year-old patients in the U.S. have decreased rates of preventative care visits compared to younger children, with 19% - 46% not having an annual preventative visit (Child Health, 2020; Rand, 2018). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to determine if preventative care affects adolescent health behaviors compared to those that do not attend preventative visits. Thus, the goal of this study is to assess if health behaviors are addressed at preventative care visits, which in turn can affect health outcomes and decrease the numbers of preventable health conditions. The findings of this brief may provide information of how to improve the care that adolescents receive and increase preventative services provided to this population. Nurses and other healthcare providers can benefit from this research when it comes to engaging adolescent patients with their healthcare and providing education on the benefits of preventative care. Health outcomes may be improved by preventative screenings, continued management of health issues, and teaching positive health behaviors. "
A Review on the Efficacy of Ketamine Compared to Electroconvulsive Therapy in Patients with Severe Depression,"Pattee-Scariano, Caitlin; Kukulski, Melissa","Severe depression, often referred to as major depressive disorder (MDD), is a ubiquitous disease that affects every aspect of life including psychosocial and physical health. It is chronic and characterized by anhedonia, altered sleep patterns, anxiety, a sense of worthlessness and hebetude. Current treatment options for MDD have proven to be only partially effective, and in many cases not effective at all. A more recent treatment option to combat severe depression has been the focus of many studies in the recent years, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, Ketamine. Ketamine is a Schedule III non-narcotic that has commonly been used as a general anesthetic; playing an important role in procedural sedation. The past decade, Ketamine has been the center of attention in depression research and considered a likely adversary to the gold standard treatment, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT is commonly used in patients with severe depression that have not responded to other treatment; it involves electrical stimulation of the brain while the patient is under anesthesia. The purpose of this evidenced-based practice review is to compare the effects of Ketamine and ECT on patients suffering with severe depression, and to glean out the more effective treatment modality. Nurses and other health care providers can use this information to better understand the treatment options for severely depressive patients as well as assist in choosing the effective, safer treatment option for each individual.

Lowering Rates of Anxiety with SSRI's Compared to CBT,"Sullivan, Amy; Kulkuski, Melissa","Anxiety disorders are the most common of all psychiatric conditions affecting an estimated 19.1% of adults and 7% of children in the United States (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2017). These disorders are treatable with medical intervention, however, only 36.9% of psychiatric patients seek treatment for their anxiety (Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 2021). Patients who seek treatment are usually treated with either cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). CBT is a form of psychological treatment that involves efforts to change thinking and behavioral patterns by the psychologist and patient working collaboratively (American Psychological Association, 2022). SSRIs are a medication taken orally that work in the brain by blocking the reabsorption of serotonin by neurons, this action allows for more serotonin to be available for us by patients (Mayo Clinic, 2019). Serotonin is a key neurotransmitter in the brain that plays an important role in regulating anxiety, happiness, and mood. The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to determine which treatment option, CBT or SSRI’s, are more effective in reducing rates and symptomatology of anxiety for psychiatric patients. Results from this study will provide nurses and other healthcare providers better direction on which treatment option to offer to patients struggling with anxiety disorders. "
Dry Needling for Treatment of Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review,"Shelton, Grace; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature about the effectiveness of dry needling interventions on osteoarthritis. Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed, CINHAL, and Google Scholar and assessed for the effectiveness of dry needling interventions on osteoarthritis. Results: The majority of literature supported the stance that dry needling interventions have a favorable effect for decreasing pain, increased mobility, and increase range of motion for patients with osteoarthritis. When different methods were directly compared, these studies didn’t identify a preferred method for best improving pain and mobility in patients with osteoarthritis. Conclusions: Dry needling interventions show promising results for patients with osteoarthritis. These interventions should be researched further to find how they can decrease pain and increase mobility in patients with osteoarthritis. The findings of this systematic review can guide clinical practice to relieving osteoarthritis with dry needling. Keywords: Osteoarthritis; dry needling; range of motion; pain; mobility. "
Effects of Kinesiotape on Athletes: A Systematic Review,"Warfle, Callie; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review relevant literature on the effects of the application of Kinesiotape on athletes. Methods: Studies were obtained through PubMed and CINAHL databases. They were assessed for relevancy to Kinesiotape application on the site of athletic injuries. Results: The literature reviewed showed Kinesiotape was associated with increased flexibly of the shoulder and hamstring, and improved ankle mobility. Much of the literature showed a decrease on pain when Kinesiotape was applied .The application of Kinesiotape was also correlated with negative performance effects including, decreased vertical jump height and decreased quadricep movement Conclusions: The application of Kinesiotape can reduce athletes’ pain levels. Kinesiotape should be used to treat injuries that result in pain. Further research should be conducted to determine the specifics of what sports and injuries benefit most from Kinesiotape. "
The Use of Ketamine Infusions for Chronic Pain,"Mihalic, Emily; Kukulski, Melissa","Chronic pain is an ongoing problem in the United States that affects millions of Americans. In 2016, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that 50 million Americans suffer from chronic pain (Dahlhammer, 2018). Often a diagnosis of chronic pain means a lifetime of costly treatments and time spent trying to find a cure, or even just some relief. One emerging treatment for chronic pain has been the use of Ketamine intravenous (IV) infusions to relieve pain without resorting to further surgeries or opiate usage. While Ketamine infusions have shown great potential for relieving chronic pain, it is still a relatively new procedure, and many questions remain about the efficacy of its use. The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to examine the question of: in patients with chronic pain, do Ketamine infusions compared to no Ketamine infusions provide better pain relief? Nurses or other healthcare providers can use this information to aid any patients they might have with intractable chronic pain by providing them with a new treatment option. This avant garde usage of Ketamine could help someone get the pain relief they may be desperate for. "
Effects of Tartrazine on Drosophila melanogaster Anxiety and Depression Behaviors,"Unterseher, Chloe; Tupper, Francie; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","Tartrazine is a yellow-tinged chemical that is used to dye food, fabric, drugs, and cosmetics yellow in the United States. Previous research has found a connection between tartrazine-rich diets and anxiety and depressive behaviors in both mice and children (El-Nabarawy et al., 2015; Kemel & El-Lethey, 2011; Rowe & Rowe, 1994). The goal of this study was to examine the effects of a tartrazine-rich larval diet on anxiety and depressive behaviors in the common fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We hypothesized that a tartrazine-rich diet would produce more anxiety and depression-related behaviors in adult Drosophila when compared to control flies not exposed to tartrazine. To test our hypothesis, an experimental group of flies was given a 3% tartrazine solution in their feeding media while the control group was given distilled water. After one to two generations, RING assays and wall-following assays were used to measure depression and anxiety behaviors, respectively. The results of the RING assay showed that the control and tartrazine-exposed flies climbed at the same rate, indicating that tartrazine did not affect depressive behaviors. Similarly, the control and tartrazine-treated groups spent the same amount of time within the outer zone during the wall following assay, suggesting that both groups were equally as anxious. Taken together, these findings suggest that tartrazine does not affect anxiety and depression-related behaviors in the common fruit fly. "
Night Shift Nursing and Breast Cancer Risk,"Bennett, Courtney; Kukulski, Melissa","Night shift work was first highlighted as a carcinogen in humans by the International Agency of Research on Cancer (IARC) in 2007 (IARC Working Group, 2020). Breast cancer, the most common cancer diagnosed in women worldwide, was explicitly associated with night shift work. More than 23 million Americans are engaged in shift work, 14.2% of whom work in the healthcare industry (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2019). Female nurses make up the most significant percentage of the healthcare industry (National Council of State Boards of Nursing, 2020). To provide care to patients 24 hours a day, these nurses are frequently engaged in night shift work. The purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to investigate the impact of night shift work on female nurses’ risk of developing breast cancer. Understanding elements of night shift work that contribute to the increased risk of breast cancer in nurses can guide healthcare organizations in making decisions to reduce the risk of occupational exposure to cancer.

Treatment During the Golden Hour and Its Effect on Patient Mortality,"Vesely, Cuyler; Kukulski, Melissa","Every year, millions of people are affected by traumatic injuries. The golden hour has been a point of education for emergency medical crews as well as emergency departments across the world in order to implement safe, effective, and suitable care for each individual. Research has been conducted to see if treatment within the ‘golden hour’ affects patient mortality rates. Specifically, the studies have examined how the timing of each intervention changes the patient’s outcomes. To test the hypothesis that treatment within the golden hour affects patient outcomes (mortality), studies have been retrospectively conducted to see when treatment happened and what eventually happened to the patient. Data was submitted to trauma committees which has since been pulled to find the correlation between treatment and outcome. The results did not necessarily state that the golden hour was supported, but they did state that a delay in treatment did negatively affect patient outcomes. Due to the findings of these studies, swift management should be initiated by emergency medical crews and emergency departments quickly to prevent potential negative outcomes. "
Childhood Obesity and Motivational Interviewing,"Manneh, Mariama; Kulkuski, Melissa","Childhood obesity is a public health problem that is increasing at an alarming rate. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) by 2056, the number of school-age children and adolescents aged 5-19 with obesity would rise from 11 million to 124 million (WHO, 2021). Today 1 in 5 children in America suffer from obesity with 1 in 4 adults being too heavy to be eligible to enlist in the military (WHO, 2021). The aim of this research is focused on exploring the use of Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a tool to help reduce obesity amongst the adolescent population aged 12-19 years. MI is defined as an effective nonjudgmental, patient-centered counseling approach to losing weight that can be delivered by a non-mental health provider. Decreasing the trend of childhood obesity in adolescents’ results in better physical health and broader benefits for society. Obesity in children can cause impaired physical and mental challenges. It increases a child’s risk for cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, type 2 diabetes as well as lower self-esteem and being at a greater risk for bullying. Through the utilization of MI, nurses can empower patients by helping them manage their own care to build a healthier future and decrease childhood obesity. "
Spinal Cord Stimulators and Opioid Use in Chronic Pain Patients,"Plancich, Paige; Kukulski, Melissa","Chronic pain affects approximately 55 million people in the United States (Nadeau, 2021). The treatment of chronic pain can include varying modalities such as chronic opioid therapy (COT), spinal cord stimulation (SCS), physical therapy, and surgery. Between 2019 and 2020, there was a 33% increase in opioid related deaths in adults aged 35-49 and 49% in young adults aged 15-24 (Mann, 2021). Patients that qualify for an SCS implant have diagnoses including complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), lumbar or thoracic radiculopathy or chronic pain in the low back and legs. It has been suggested by research that patients experience a decrease in pain by using opioids in conjunction with or without an SCS. Though chronic pain cannot always be cured, it is important to understand the treatment options available to patients and how they may be impacted by these methods. The aim of this evidence-based practice brief is to examine the effects of opioids and SCS on pain in patients that qualify for a SCS. Nurses or other healthcare providers will be able to use this information to better understand treatment options and help patients live a higher quality of life. "
Low Birth Weight and Maternal Education,"Eaton, Tess; Kukulski, Melissa","Low infant birth weight (LBW) is a significant indicator of infant mortality, and health risk later in the child’s life. LBW is defined as infants born with a weight of less than 2,500 grams (WHO, 2022). LBW affects societies all over the world from families losing their babies, to the impact of disease on healthcare and society as a whole. ""Epidemiological observations depicted that infants born with low birth weight (LBW) [are] approximately 20 times more likely to die than heavier babies, due to a wide range of poor health outcomes"" (Shome et al., 2018, p.1).One contributing factor being studied is maternal education level. Socioeconomic status and education level are well known to be associated with poor health outcomes. Education levels of mothers, in most of the studies, are defined as primary, secondary, or higher education. The Purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice Brief is to compare low maternal education levels versus high maternal education levels (independent variables) in predicting the incidences of low birth weight (dependent variable) in infants. LBW has mortal and life-long consequences and understanding the factors that contribute to it help pave the way in preventing LBW, and help nurses understand how best to serve their patients "
The Effects of Implementing TeamSTEPPS in Emergency Departments,"Wilkerson, Abigail; Kukulski, Melissa","Medical errors are currently the third leading cause of death in Americans (McMains, 2016). It has been shown that the greatest number of medical errors happen in fast-paced settings such as the emergency department (ED) with the greatest cause of medical errors being poor communication and teamwork. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) set out to amend those flaws and improve the healthcare system. Thus, the Team Strategies and Tools to Enhance Performance and Patient Safety (TeamSTEPPS) program was created. TeamSTEPPS is a systematic, evidence-based program that delivers structure, safety specific dialect, and communication strategies to individuals and teams in an attempt to create a culture of safety to its users (AHRQ, n.d. para 3).The purpose of this Evidence Based Practice Review is to explore if implementing a TeamSTEPPS program in an emergency department improves communication and teamwork among healthcare staff. Communication is essential in the healthcare field with nurses being the central hub of patient care. By learning and utilizing evidence-based communication strategies and integrating them into practice at the workplace, nurses can ignite the change they wish to see and to reduce harm to patients, save lives, and do their part to create a safety of culture in healthcare. "
Skin-to-Skin Contact and Breastfeeding,"Eckert, Lauren; Kukulski, Melissa","Immediate skin-to-skin contact has been shown to provide many health benefits for mothers and their newborns, including increased breastfeeding success. Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in the world is currently only 37%, with few hospitals adopting measures to improve skin-to-skin contact (Agudelo et al, 2021). One major factor in determining the success of breastfeeding is providing skin-to-skin contact (SSC) with the mother as soon as possible following birth. There are numerous benefits of breastfeeding for both the newborn and the mother. For the newborn, breastmilk provides antibodies from the mother to help protect it from illness. It also lowers rates of infant mortality and morbidities. Breastfed babies are generally healthier throughout their lives and have less risk of developing chronic diseases such as cancer or diabetes. Breastfeeding also has many benefits for the mother as well, these include improved mental and physical health in the postpartum period, and lifelong health benefits such as lower risk of cancer, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease (Cleveland Clinic, 2017). The impact of SSC on breastfeeding is not something that has been studied extensively in the past, therefore, few hospitals have adopted immediate SSC. The purpose of this research article is to determine if immediate skin to skin contact compared to early (but delayed) skin to skin contact, impacts the ability to breastfeed successfully in full term neonates. The independent variable being the skin-to-skin contact, the dependent variable being breastfeeding success. "
The Effectiveness of the Modified Valsalva Maneuver in Terminating Episodes of Supraventricular Tachycardia,"Morgan, Haley; Kukulski, Melissa","Vagal maneuvers have been used in the termination of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) episodes. SVT is a common arrhythmia characterized by rapid heart rates which affect the upper chambers of the heart. These maneuvers act as a mechanism to slow the heart rate without medication or invasive procedures. SVT is prevalent across the lifespan, however, it is commonly seen in young women. This Evidence-Based Practice Brief aims to understand the efficacy of modified Valsalva maneuver compared to other interventions such as standard Valsalva maneuver, Carotid Sinus massage, and the head down deep breathing method in adult patients over the age of 18. The modified Valsalva maneuver has been suggested to be up to 2.5 times more effective than the traditionally used standard Valsalva maneuver (Abdulhamid et al., 2021). Thorough analysis of three primary research articles was done and there was evidence of higher efficacy in modified Valsalva maneuvers compared to the other maneuvers, however, due to inconsistent inclusion criteria and inadequate sample sizes in the studies, further research is needed in order to fully answer the PICOT question. The findings of this Brief can help to inform nurses on whether implementing the modified Valsalva maneuver should be first line treatment over other vagal maneuvers. "
The Effects of Patient-Centered Care Versus Usual Care on Patient Health and Safety,"Kennelly, Hunter; Kukulski, Melissa","Patient-centered care has a history of providing improved patient health and safety outcomes, yet controversy over how to define patient-centered care, as well as lacking evidence of long-term effects, produces hesitation of clinical implementation and suggests that this type of care requires further research analysis. The purpose of the following research analysis is to determine whether new, evidence-based practice protocols should be implemented regarding standardization of patient-centered care. The PICOT question relating to this review is: If nurses utilize person/ patient-centered care educational methods, compared to standardized/ usual treatment-specific methods, do patient health and safety outcomes improve? Three, independent randomized controlled trials (RCT) were assessed and included varying patient demographics, geographical region of subject population, length of study, patient medical diagnosis, and variations of nurse-led patient-centered care compared to usual methods of care determined by hospital protocol and physician standard operating procedure. Results of each RCT demonstrated statistical significance of improved patient outcomes for individuals diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or congestive heart failure (CHF), acute coronary syndrome, or hypertensive nephropathy, indicated by P of 0.06, P < 0.001, and P < 0.008 respectively. Due to this mixture of variables and positive trends of positive outcomes in each study, research suggests that patient-centered care may be used for any population of patients within healthcare, and can be applied using numerous methods of nurse-led interventions.

Pilot Study: A Preliminary Investigation into Bitterroots in Scratch Gravel,"Wohlers, Joseph; Almquist, Travis","Bitterroot (Lewisia rediviva) is the Montana state flower, and its populations are often a conservation concern. They require little moisture, and they are highly resilient to drought, disturbances, and fire. Recently, many habitats that are important for bitterroot populations have been exposed to increasing use by outdoor recreation such as mountain biking, disc golfing, and hiking. The Scratch Gravel Hills northwest of the Helena valley contains substantial bitterroot populations, but has also seen recent increases in recreational and ecological disturbances. The Bureau of Land Management is currently working on instating new recreational management in this area to preserve the state flower. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of disturbance on bitterroot population densities to help inform management decision-making. Two study areas were surveyed to evaluate the effect of disturbance on bitterroot populations. High-density foot traffic areas were compared to off-trail, non-traffic areas that represent natural site conditions. There was a significantly higher population density in the high disturbance recreational areas relative to the low disturbance natural areas. This pilot study should inform future research into the role of disturbance type, frequency, and severity and could be used in developing future management plans for multi-use conservation areas. "
What is Most Necessary to Improve the Human Condition? Choosing Integrity Despite Societal Pressure: St. Augustine Confessions & Virginia Woolf A Room of One’s Own,"Borzadek, Sofie; Street, Alex","In Confessions, by Saint Augustine, and A Room of One’s Own, by Virginia Woolf, both writers feel pressure from their societies to commit actions that go against their values or to fit into a mold that does not suit their beliefs. Augustine discusses his fall into sexual sin and his transformation to freedom through integrity found in God, while Woolf chooses to defy the societal roles placed on women through her works as a writer. These authors explore conditions under which they felt social pressure, and yet it was more beneficial for them to act in accordance with their own values. Both texts navigate the question of why it may be necessary to follow one's own integrity and reject society’s pressure, however, they seem to find different sources of integrity. The stylistic choice of both authors to write autobiographically reflects their desire to share with others the nature in which they were able to improve their condition. For Augustine, this was in the act of humility against his lustful and prideful past, while for Woolf it was finding her voice in a male-dominated society. "
"""In Countries, Discord:"" The Forming of Good and Just Human Societies","Jarman, Anna; Street, Alexander","Aristotle’s Nicomachean Ethics and Shakespeare’s King Lear explore the strength of human societies as founded upon individual relationships. For Aristotle, a society’s health depends on a certain degree of cohesion among the ruling elites. Without like-mindedness of purpose, a kind of political love, a country becomes divided against itself and cannot stand. In Shakespeare’s tragedy, we see the foolish King Lear abdicate his throne and attempt to pass the rule of Britain onto his daughters. However, from the start of the play there is clear division amongst the royal family, especially between Goneril, Regan, and Cordelia. As a result, we see confirmation of Aristotle’s principles concerning like-mindedness as the self-serving Goneril, Regan, and Edmund ultimately fail to establish any kind of strong kingdom in Britain. This presentation explores the relational roadblocks to forming human society as demonstrated in King Lear through the lens of Aristotle’s virtue ethics, as well as questioning the inevitability of a society's downfall.

Sexual Inequality and The Adverse Impacts on Women,"Brewer, Amber; Dolan, Jamie; Roncalli, Elvira","Throughout history, women have experienced sexual inequality, and this continues to occur within today’s society. Gender inequality could be defined as men and women having different access to resources and power, causing unlike treatment. Sexual inequality could be defined in a variety of ways and I am going to focus on how women experience inequality in sexual interactions with men while also taking into account women’s condition of inequality is not limited to just this. These inequalities are credited to the societal gender norms that oppress women and have been widely tolerated by women, reinforced by society, and leave a negative impact on women. I will be focusing specifically on how the objectification of women, sex in heterosexual relationships, and slut-shaming and victim blaming are contributions to the harmful effects that sexual inequality has on women.

Investigation of Nicotine’s Effect on Drosophila Melanogaster Motor Function and Aggression,"Nelson, Carrie; Normandeau, James; Otto-Hitt, Stefanie","Nicotine, a highly addictive chemical, is a common component of e-cigarette juice. Given e-cigarette popularity among teenagers and young adults, we decided to investigate the link between nicotine and behavior. Our project specifically investigated nicotine’s connection to Drosophila melanogaster (the common fruit fly) motor function and aggression. Previous studies have shown that nicotine results in increased acetylcholine release, which impacts the regulation of motor movement. Nicotine use also stimulates an increase in dopamine and serotonin, both of which are tied to aggressive behavior. We hypothesized that the higher the concentration of nicotine introduced to the D. melanogaster, the more motor function would decrease due to increased levels of acetylcholine. Furthermore, we hypothesized that as nicotine concentration increased, D. melanogaster would exhibit aggressive behavior faster. The results of our study showed a significant decrease in motor function between D. melanogaster controls and those treated with vaping fluid containing 0% and 1.2%. In our aggression assay, we found a significant decrease in the time it took for D. melanogaster exposed to any vaping fluid to display aggressive behavior. Overall, our findings show that exposure to vaping liquid with or without nicotine affects motor function and aggressive behavior in D. melanogaster. "
Changing Times: Translation and meaning in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,"4) Wallis, Caleb; Graham, Loren","Despite its popularity in recent media, we know almost nothing about the author of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, or of the context surrounding it. In fact, the entire poem is relatively new to us, only having been rediscovered in the 19th century. Despite this, however, it has managed to carve itself an almost irreplaceable quarter in Arthurian literature. We are enthralled by the poem’s imagery–visages of Mary’s Star, of that great, green rider haunting the narrative and Gawain himself–by its alliterative form, and by its hidden meanings; faith, chastity, chivalry. These concepts, combined with a lack of true “authority” over the poem, has created one of the English language’s most cherished and translated works of Medieval literature–yet, all of these translations have something different to say about the form, concepts, and even characters present in the narrative. Much of this difference stems from linguistic evolution on behalf of English. As the language evolved, so too did the ideologies of the people speaking it, leading to certain words developing multiple or entirely different connotations or meanings over the centuries. It is this evolution that I tackle in my presentation using both the original text and multiple modern translations. Through examination of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight’s classic language as filtered through translation, I aim to highlight how evolution of the English language has altered, or in some cases simply developed, our interpretations of the text.

"Comparing the Recommended Protein Intake to the Actual Protein Intake Among Collegiate Athletes, a Systematic Review","Loveless, Sophie; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature concerning actual protein intake and familiarity with recommended protein intake targets among collegiate athletes in order to maintain and optimize muscle mass. Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed and Google Scholar and assessed for the recommended protein intake for collegiate athletes. Results: A majority of the literature stated that the recommended protein intake for a collegiate athlete is 1.4 to 2.0 g/kg/d. Overall, the average intake and awareness of the recommended amount of protein consumption were less than the recommended protein intake. Conclusions: The target protein intake of no more than 2.0 g/kg/d has shown promising results for collegiate athletes and their optimization of muscle mass. The conclusions of this review can be used to help college sports nutritionists to create awareness of the importance of adequate protein consumption in athletes. "
Postpartum Pelvic Floor Physiotherapy and Sexual Functioning,"Scofield, Lauren; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","In the United States in 2020, there were 2,462,904 registered vaginal births, which equates to roughly 68% of the births in the U.S. that year (Osterman, 2022). Women experience a combination of physical, hormonal, and psychological changes with vaginal deliveries that impact female sexual functioning. Physical alterations to the pelvic floor muscles that occur during a vaginal delivery, such as hypotonicity and poor healing may have a large influence on postpartum sexual functioning (Pourkhiz, 2017). Pelvic floor muscle therapy (PFMT) is a subspecialty of physiotherapy that can be utilized to increase the strength of the pelvic muscles during the postpartum period and PFMT may be able to be utilized as a first-line therapy for postpartum sexual functioning. The purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to explore the impact of pelvic floor physiotherapy, or PFMT exercises, on sexual functioning in postpartum women, following a vaginal delivery. Nurses or other healthcare providers can use this information to facilitate the delivery of comprehensive education options to postpartum women upon hospital discharge. Inclusion of education about specific PFMT exercises and protocols can be reinforced by nursing staff and may provide a significant improvement to postpartum sexual self-efficacy and sexual functioning.

Therapeutic Play and Anxiety in Hospitalized Children,"Hohmann, Heidi; Burkholder, Stephanie","COVID-19 pediatric hospitalization have risen significantly over the past few months with over 600 hospitalizations each day in the United States for children aged 0-17 (CDC, 2022). Hospitalization is a stressful time for children and their families: 1 in 10 hospitalized children experience anxiety and depression (Doupknik, 2019). To reduce the negative psychological impact that hospitalization has on children, therapeutic play may be the answer. Therapeutic play in the medical setting utilizes toys, drawings, tools, or videos to demonstrate a medical procedure to a child. This type of play allows children to communicate with themselves, family, and healthcare staff to process their emotions; thus, decreasing overall anxiety levels. The purpose of this study is to examine whether or not therapeutic play interventions would decrease anxiety in hospitalized school-aged children ages 6-12 years. "
Companions in the Trenches: The Effects of the Animals on the Soldiers of World War 1,"Mecham, Hunter; Sumridge, Molly","War is a hellish experience for any individual to ever have to go through. It takes a toll on both the mind and the body. To try to counter the mental hardship of war, many battalions and platoons adopt animal mascots to represent the soldiers. For this paper we define a mascot as a person, animal, or object adopted by a group as a symbolic figure, especially to bring them good luck. In the case of World War 1, these mascots were very commonly living breathing animals that the soldiers would commonly interact with. Animals did not only hold the position of mascot in the Great War though, and held many other supporting jobs for the armies of the time. This paper is a comprehensive literature review of how animals affected these soldiers at war mentally and physically, as well as how they went on to affect the common public perception of animals in the decade following the war.

Effect of Distraction Methods on Pediatric Pain Report,"Schwab, Lauren; Feldkamp, Alyssa; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","Data from children’s hospitals reveal that pain in pediatric patients is common, under-recognized, and under-treated (International Association for the Study of Pain, 2021). Pain may be difficult for a child to verbalize and may present as crying or whimpering, changes in breathing, and guarding the painful area. Due to this difficulty in assessment, pediatric pain can be more objectively measured using multiple scales that include objective observations of behaviors that signify pain. Pediatric patients are exposed to procedural pain during medical procedures such as immunizations and venipunctures. “Procedural pain was the most frequently cited source of pain among interviewed patients and was poorly addressed in the medical record. Fifty percent of children with documented moderate-to-severe pain received scheduled pain medications.” (Shomaker, et al., 2015) In order to provide competent care to every patient, it is important for a nurse to utilize a holistic approach when determining patient interventions for pain. Consequently, nurses must have a knowledge of the different methods used to decrease pain for every age ranging from neonatal to geriatric. While the focus is on providing safe dependable care to each patient, it is common to principally advance to using pharmacological interventions to decrease pain, which can have many adverse side effects. For this reason, knowledge of nonpharmacological pain interventions, such as distraction techniques, and their impacts play a large role in providing holistic, safe care. The purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to explore the effect of distraction techniques on the report of pain in pediatric patients undergoing painful procedures. Nurses can use this information to implement both practices of advocacy and safety in order to provide equitable care to a population that often goes overlooked. "
Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy in Pediatric Clients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: A Systematic Reveiw,"Olsen, Danielle; Shafer, Gerald","Objectives: To review the effectiveness of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy (EMDR) in decreasing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms in children. Methods: Literature was gathered using the databases PubMed and CINAHL that assessed the use of EMDR therapy on children with PTSD. Results: All sources showed a decrease in PTSD symptoms after completing EMDR therapy sessions. However, in most of the reports, EMDR therapy and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy did not significantly differ in the reduction of PTSD symptoms. Conclusion: Eye Movement and Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy shows promising results in decreasing PTSD symptoms, comparable to those of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy. Although the difference in the results of both therapeutic interventions is not significant, both treatments should continue to be researched in order to provide clarity about which intervention might be more effective in various populations.

Factors Influencing Test Performance,"Bradt, Katie; Johnston, Traci; Otis, Landry; Arnold, Megan; Roberts, Maverick; Honzel, Nikki","This study investigates the effect of different noise conditions on students’ test performance and test anxiety. Thirty-three undergraduate students attending Carroll College participated in this study. The participants were randomly assigned to three noise conditions: control (no noise), white noise, and nature noise. Participants were given the Texas State University’s Student Learning Assistance Center’s version of Sunnis Test Anxiety Behavior Scale, a practice ACT reading test, and Speilberger’s 1980 Test Anxiety Inventory. The first questionnaire measured the student’s general test anxiety, the ACT measured the student’s test performance, and the last questionnaire measured the student’s test anxiety pertaining to the practice test. Results indicated no significant difference between the three noise conditions regarding general test anxiety, test performance, or test anxiety. Upon further analysis, there were marginally significant differences between the control group and nature group on test performance – indicating that students in the nature group performed better on the ACT than those in the control group. Additionally, there were marginally significant differences between the control group and nature group on test anxiety – indicating that students in the nature group had decreased test anxiety compared to the students in the control group. Implications for this study suggest that while there was no effect of noise, the lack of findings may be attributed to increased general test anxiety in the control group. "
Radioligand Therapy and Targeted Antigen Therapy in Treatment of Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review,"Jensen, Lucas; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature about the treatment of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by comparing radioligand therapy (RLT) and targeted antigen therapy (TAT) to standard treatment options. Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed and CINHAL to investigate the effectiveness of RLT with Lutetium-177 and TAT with Actinium-225 in treating this cancer. Results: The literature showed significant decrease in cancer volumes and an increase in overall survival with both treatments in patients with mCRPC. The findings indicate that TAT with Actinium-225 displayed a greater decrease in cancer volume and longer overall survival, compared to RLT with Lutetium-177. Conclusion: RLT and TAT have shown positive effects in treating patients with mCRPC compared to standard treatments like chemotherapy. More research is needed to be done to determine which treatment is more effective, Lutetium-177 or Actinium-225. Keywords: Radioligand therapy; targeted antigen therapy; metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer; Lutetium-177; Actinium-225. "
"Combined Targeted Therapy of Herceptin and Perjeta for HER2-Positive Breast Cancer, a Systemic Review","Donaldson, Katie; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review current literature regarding the survival rates of women with HER2-positive breast cancer using the targeted treatment therapy of Herceptin and Perjeta along with docetaxel (chemotherapy) versus Herceptin and docetaxel alone. Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed and Google Scholar that assessed the effectiveness of Herceptin and Perjeta treatment on HER2-positve breast cancer. The treatment consisted of injections of Herceptin and Perjeta along with docetaxel. Results: The literature indicates that overall, a treatment therapy of Herceptin and Perjeta along with docetaxel resulted in greater survival rates among HER2-positive breast cancer patients than with Herceptin and docetaxel alone. Conclusions: Targeted drug therapy of Herceptin and Perjeta along with docetaxel shows promising improvements in survival rates for women with HER2-positive breast cancer. The treatments studied in this review should be further researched to determine which lead to the best outcomes. "
The Effectiveness of Transcutaneous Nerve Stimulation on Patients with Knee Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review,"Bedke, Austin; Schafer, Gerald","Objective. To evaluate relevant literature on the effectiveness of transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. Methods. Studies found through PubMed and CINAHL databases were reviewed for correlations between the use of transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) and effectiveness of knee osteoarthritis (OA) treatment. Results. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) was shown to be an effective treatment in several ways. It was shown to decrease pain associated with knee osteoarthritis (OA), improve physical test scores, and to be just as effective as intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Conclusions. Transcutaneous nerve stimulation has shown to be an effective treatment for knee osteoarthritis (OA). Although the only true solution to knee OA is a complete knee arthroplasty, TENS has shown to have beneficial effects on the symptoms associated with knee OA. "
The Effectiveness of Low Dose Aspirin for Preventing Preeclampsia: A Systematic Review,"Graham, Sarah; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review published literature on the effectiveness of low dose aspirin (LDA) as a preventative treatment for preeclampsia. Methods: Literature on LDA interventions for preeclampsia was gathered from PubMed and summarized. Results: Study findings varied regarding the effectiveness of LDA as a prevention for preeclampsia, however most studies showed some benefit to the intervention. Groups for which LDA was most effective as a prevention included pregnant women with stage 1 hypertension and nulliparous women. Conclusion: LDA can be used as a preventive treatment for preeclampsia, but its effectiveness varies among the population of pregnant women. Why it works well in some groups at high risk for preeclampsia and not others need to be analyzed further. The benefit of LDA intervention outweighs the risk in many cases and the use of aspirin was not found to be harmful. Key Words: Preeclampsia; nulliparous; normotensive; hypertension "
The Catholic Church and the Holocaust,"4-29) Robertson, John Paul; Meyer, Eric","This paper explores the motivating factors of the Catholic Church’s heavily criticized lack of response and action taken during the Holocaust. Through addressing distinctions between the Church’s institutional response and responses of individuals, and exploring the ambitions of both Pope Pius XI and Pope Pius XII, two prominent determinants become apparent for the inadequate response: a deeply rooted history of anti-semtism and fear derived from a state of political weakness.

Difference in Afghanistan War Public Opinion Between 9/11 Generation and Post 9/11 Generation,"Fetzer, Michaela; Street, Alexabder","My hypothesis is: H1: The post 9/11 generation did not have a Rally-Round-the-Flag effect due 9/11. However, the Rally-Round-the-Flag effect is shown in the 9/11 generations opinion of the Afghanistan war. I believe the change of America's public opinion on the Afghanistan war over time correlates to someone remembering 9/11. The research will contribute to literature regarding the American public's opinion of the Afghanistan war. To research the public's opinion, I used data from surveys that show the public opinion over time and analyze it for myself. The data tested whether the change of America's public opinion on the Afghanistan war over time correlates to someone remembering 9/11. I believed those who remember living through 9/11 are more likely to believe we should be in the Afghanistan war, and those who were not born nor remember 9/11 do not support the Afghanistan war due to them being too young. Since I cannot measure someone’s memories, I plan to compare by age and veteran status someone’s opinion to questions about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. My presentation plans to explain my analysis of American National Election Studies Times Series Study (ANNES) survey from 2012 data, as well as and Pew Research Center's American Trends Panel survey from 2019 data. The differences in data between the years for the 9/11 generation and the post-9/11 generation will allow my study to confirm the hypothesis. "
A Melody for Anxiety Relief in ICU Patients,"Wharton, Cassie; Carlson, Josh; Westby, Brooke; Burkholder, Stephanie","Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) can experience varying levels of anxiety. A recent study performed on ICU patients, found that 45% of patients in the ICU will experience anxiety that can be documented (May et al.,2019). These rates are clinically significant as anxiety can result in many symptoms including the feeling of restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and long term effects such as elevated blood pressure and infection (National institute of Mental Health, 2018). Currently, typical treatment for anxiety is focused on pharmacological interventions or medications. However, the use of nonpharmacological interventions, such as music therapy, have begun to be explored further. For the purpose of this brief, anxiety can be defined as “an emotion characterized by feelings of tension, worried thoughts, and physical changes like increased blood pressure” (American Psychological Association, 2022). In addition, music therapy is defined as ""the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship"" (American Music Therapy Association, 2005). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to examine the efficacy of music therapy on anxiety levels in ICU patients. The results of this review may lead to an increase in music therapy interventions for patients that experience anxiety during their stay in an intensive care unit. Nurses will then be able to use this information to determine the most effective way to treat patients in the ICU that are experiencing anxiety. "
Metabolic Pathway Changes in Gout and Rheumatoid Arthritis: Finding Etiology from Human Synovial Fluid,"Schaan, Amanda; Hahn, Alyssa","Gout and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) are two forms of inflammatory arthritis. Gout causes joint pain and inflammation due to uric acid crystals forming in the joints. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that damages the lining of synovial joints, it can also affect the skin, eyes, brain, heart, and lungs. The etiology of the diseases is not totally understood and there is no cure. Previously studies have found that there is a metabolic link to these conditions. This study will analyze synovial fluid metabolites from one patient with gout and one patient with RA. These metabolite concentrations will be compared to metabolite concentrations from healthy synovial fluid samples to find statistically significant differences in metabolites. These metabolites will show which metabolic pathways are disturbed in the diseases to discern which metabolic pathways are affected in gout and RA. This will lead to a better understanding of what causes these conditions "
Examining the Role of Property Through John Locke and Karl Marx,"Clark, Brady; Street, Alexander","Scholars throughout history have contested the value and importance of property, whether that be in regards to its ownership, its purpose, etc. Perhaps two of the most relevant thinkers to this idea are John Locke and Karl Marx. This presentation will look to present Locke and Marx’s remarks on property in a comparative and contrasting maner. Both authors begin with similar ideas but end up with wildly different conclusions. This presentation will first address the commonalities between the two, with an emphasis on how both believe the common individual should have a right to property, then move onto an analysis of their conclusions and the means by which they draw those conclusions. Locke concludes the government should do more to protect the average individual’s property as well as maintain consensual transactions, while Marx concludes that private property should be abolished as the average individual can no longer meaningfully obtain property in a bourgeois society. The presentation will conclude with an evaluation and application of these different conclusions. "
Virtual Reality and Pain Management in Pediatric Oncology,"McKay, Katelyn; Patel, Krupa; Walker, Linsey; Kukulski, Melissa; Burkholder, Stephanie","Globally, 400,000 pediatric clients will be diagnosed with cancer every year, making pain management especially important in pediatric oncology settings (WHO, 2021). Pediatric oncology is a branch of medicine that deals with preventing, diagnosing, and treating cancer—uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells—in infants, children, and adolescents. Pain management is the assessment and treatment of different types of pain (Cleveland Clinic Medical Professional, 2021). Poor pain management can hinder childhood development and increase childhood morbidity, ultimately impacting the health and wellbeing of pediatric oncology patients (Gan, 2017). The typical standard of care for pain management in the pediatric oncology population consists of pharmacological interventions, NSAIDs and opioids, and nonpharmacological interventions such as art therapy, music therapy, and massage (ACCO, 2022). In conjunction with standard of care practices, virtual reality has shown promise in being an effective non pharmacological method to treat pain, especially in the pediatric population. Virtual reality is the utilization “of computer technology to create the effect of an interactive three-dimensional world in which the objects have a sense of spatial presence” (Bryson, 2021). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice Review is to explore how virtual reality impacts pain management in pediatric patients with cancer. Nurses play an essential role in pain management. Nurses must advocate for patients to receive optimal pain treatment and collaborate interprofessionally to design individualized pain management regimens. "
Effects of Massage Therapy on Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review,"Durfey, Trent; Schafer, Gerald","Objective: To review literature regarding the benefits of massage therapy for treating the symptoms of osteoarthritis. Methods: PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar were used to identify articles included in this systematic review. These studies looked at massage therapy and its effects on osteoarthritis. Results: Seven of the eight articles used in this review found that massage therapy reduced the patients’ symptoms of osteoarthritis and increased their quality of life. The other article found that the optimal dosage of massage therapy needed to get the best results was once a week for 60 minutes. Conclusion: Massage therapy has many positive effects on reducing symptoms of osteoarthritis. Massage therapy has shown to reduce pain, increase range of motion, and improve quality of life. "
Using Liquid-Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry to Determine Metabolite Makeup Within Osteoarthritic and Healthy Synovial Fluid,"Hanson, Alex; Xiong, SiaMee; Hahn, Dr. Alyssa","Metabolomics is emerging as a new field of scientific study used to reveal metabolic phenotypes of diseases and disorders. Metabolomics has recently been employed to study osteoarthritis, which is the leading cause of arthritis across the world. OA is associated with degeneration of joint tissues, in particular the articular cartilage. OA is considered irreversible by the time of diagnosis because cartilage is avascular and thus has minimal regeneration capacities. This breakdown in cartilage leads to painful interaction between bones in these joints. The disease is only easily diagnosed in later stages using MRI or X-Ray images, when the symptoms have progressed so far that the joint becomes painful for the patient. Because of this, we plan to use metabolomics in order to find a new way to diagnose OA in earlier stages before the symptoms have progressed. Liquid Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy (LC-MS) will be used to separate and assign masses to metabolites found within samples of healthy and osteoarthritic synovial fluid effusion samples. The program MetaboAnalyst will be used to determine if there are significant differences in the metabolite populations within these samples. Differences in the makeup of metabolites within these two samples would be a potential earlier form of diagnosis for OA, helping physicians to start treatments for the disease before it has progressed.

Expanding Coaching Boys Into Men,"Maes, Emilie; Holmes, Bray; Brensdal, Bryan; Duffy, Brandon; Sullivan, Michael; Huttle, Ellen; Durfey, Trent; Lambrecht, London; Thurston, Broder; Parsley, Kelly","It is no secreet that sexual violence is ubiquitous on college campuses. Several universities have implemented a program to educate young men on the impacts of these crimes as well as ways to be effective bystanders. Effective bystander training increases “students’ perceived knowledge, self-efficacy and perceived benefits to helping in an alcohol-related emergency.” Despite this, many students decline university-provided bystander training and sexual violence prevention workshops. One of the largest barriers to students attending and participating in such workshops is often their preconceived notions that this is not an issue for them. The students in Public Health Theories and Practice (PH 333) completed a literature review of 28 academic articles to gain better understanding and awareness of sexual violence on college campuses. Upon completing this research, students identified available resources that provide services in the community of Helena, Montana. To increase student education and awareness regarding sexual violence and victim services, students in PH 333 devloped a plan to reach male student-athletes. By implementing the Coaching Boys into Men program, male athletes on campus will be educated on sexual assault prevention along with bystander training using discussions led by trained professionals. This program has been implemented by the football team, but we will aim to create additional trainings in order to develop a new culture of sexual assault awareness, prevention, and response on the entire campus of Carroll College. "
Contraceptive Methods and Depression Rates,"Dahle, Katie; Hadley, Jessica; Nguyen, Christina; Burkholder, Stephanie; Kukulski, Melissa","It is safe to say not all women will experience depression as a side effect of contraception, but what if there was a way to tell if the form of birth control the woman chose could impact this behavior? Approximately 65% of women in the United States are currently on some form of birth control (CDC, 2019). There are different kinds of contraceptive methods including hormonal and non-hormonal used by sexually active women. With all of these options there are a plethora of side effects that may accompany them. Some expected side effects from hormonal contraceptives include cramps, acne, and mood changes. These mood changes could ultimately lead to chronic depression and negative self concept. In the United States, 1 in 10 women suffer from depression (CDC, 2020). The purpose of this evidence based practice review is to further explore the correlation between hormonal and non hormonal contraceptive methods with depression rates. Constant research is essential to keep up with best practices for women’s mental health. By looking into further research studies regarding contraceptive use, the decision-making process may be greatly altered in future women looking at contraception choices. As nurses, educating patients is essential to prevent future complications from arising. By knowing the correlation between depression development and contraceptive methods, nurses and other healthcare providers can better counsel patients to choose the best and most effective method for each individual. "
ACE Scores and Frequency of Emergency Room Utilization,"Hoikkala, Savannah; Burkholder, Stephanie","Adverse Childhood Experiences otherwise known as ACEs are traumatic experiences during childhood that occur before the age of eighteen that are linked to abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction. The ACE scores are calculated by a survey of 10 criterias in which an individual can qualify for one or more or none (Casa Mental Health, 2022). Annually in the United States, 130 million people visit the emergency room according to the National Center for Health Statistics (CDC, 2021). In the United States 61% of adults had at least once ACE and 16% had 4 or more types of ACEs (CDC, 2019). Emergency room (ER) nurses are likely to care for patients with ACE scores as studies show that over half the population has been exposed to ACE. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2019), one in every six adults experience four or more types of ACEs during their childhood. This is crucial because it is known that exposure to ACEs are related to increased risk for health problems across the entire life span (CDC, 2019). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to explore the relationship between ACE scores and the frequency of emergency room or emergency department utilization. Nurses or other healthcare providers can use this information to provide better care and potentially reduce the utilization of the emergency department by directing patients to specialists related to the patient’s specific physical or mental healthcare needs.

Perceptions of Carroll College Students on the Idea of Therapy Dogs on Campus,"Tibbetts, Jennifer; Sumridge, Molly","Since the 1960s, researchers have studied how therapy dogs have benefited humans (Therapy dogs for depression & anxiety 2019), focusing on factors such as demographics, pet ownership, and other conditions. This research was conducted through a series of questionnaires using the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-Being Scale (WEMWBS)(Grajfoner et al. 2017). Results showed that a ""significant"" amount of the participants showed improved anxiety and mood levels (Grajfoner et al. 2017). Despite all the research, there is a gap in our understanding of public perceptions of therapy dogs. The study involved 100 students from Carroll College in a descriptive statistical analysis and phenomenological survey. The lack of knowledge on therapy dogs shown is concerning. Over 50% of students provided a description or example of what they believed was a therapy dog. "
Solvent-less Substitution Reactions,"Caffee, Logan; Pharr, Caroline","Most chemical reactions include the use of solvents. These solvents are often hazardous and proper disposal is very costly. This investigation explores a solid-state substitution reaction from the starting material 4,4’- Bis(bromomethyl)biphenyl. Substitution reactions are commonly used to introduce different functional groups into molecules for use in various applications. This project is significant as it contributes to the green chemistry movement that began in the 1990s, which aims to prevent the generation of hazardous wastes and materials.1 "
"Global Metabolic Analysis of Synovial Fluid Extraction Between ACL Tear, General Trauma, and Osteoarthritis Patients","Carlson, Ashley; James, Hailey; Hahn, Alyssa","Osteoarthritis is an inflammatory disease found in the joints causing severe pain and discomfort in patients. Joint trauma is thought to be one cause of osteoarthritis as patients with prior injury often develop the disease later in life. This experiment will use the study of metabolomics to compare the biomarkers found in synovial fluid extracted from patients who have experienced trauma in the knee and those with osteoarthritis. The patient samples include joint trauma from tearing of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and general trauma. The biomarkers found in the ACL tear and general trauma samples are expected to be similar to those found in the osteoarthritis patient samples, thereby providing a potential link between trauma and development of osteoarthritis. By analyzing using metabolomics, a snapshot of the activity within the synovial fluid immediately after an injury will be assessed and thereby provide important information for future research. This research will use liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy and various statistical and functional analyses to understand these differences between trauma and diseased groups. "
Perestroika: A Story of American Intelligence and Political Chaos,"Irby, Thomas; Pavlakis, Dean","This paper looks to capture the relationship between the Central Intelligence Agency and the final years of the Soviet Union under former General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev. Within this complex relationship, I specifically sought to explore how the CIA interpreted Gorbachev’s future as the leader of the Soviet Union and how their vision shifted over time. Using documents such as National Intelligence Dailys, memorandums from CIA personnel, and other various documents, I was able to discover a shift in tone and message when discussing Gorbachev’s future. From 1985 until late 1988, the CIA operated under the assumption that Gorbachev was going to have ample time to implement his reforms under Perestroika, just as the majority of Generals Secretaries had, excluding Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko. However, a shift occurred in the early months of 1989 due to political unrest within the party, public dissatisfaction with the communist party, and the inability to implement economic reforms forcing the CIA to prepare for a time when Gorbachev’s tenure would end sooner rather than later.

Quality of Care in the NICU Depending on Race,"Burgess, Ella; Maruca, Grace; Pearson, Andrea; Burkholder, Stephanie; Kukulski, Melissa","The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is a unit in the hospital for babies who need intensive medical care. The NICU has specialized technology and trained staff to take care of these infants (Stanford Children's Health, 2022). Even while NICU patients are receiving specialized care, racial disparities persist. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, “Non-Hispanic blacks/African Americans have 2.3 times the infant mortality rate as non-Hispanic whites” (2021). Poor health outcomes for African American neonates compared to Caucasian neonates have been a long standing issue. Regardless of a patient's race, quality of care should be the highest it can be in order to minimize avoidable adverse health outcomes. Looking into the care of NICU patients can provide a glimpse at the quality of care between different races and where racial disparities might exist. According to Howard Law, “Racial disparity refers to the imbalances and incongruities between the treatment of racial groups, including economic status, income, housing options, societal treatment, safety, and myriad other aspects” (2021). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to dig deeper into racial disparities that exist within the field of healthcare. This information can be used to help decrease the inequality of NICU patients and improve their quality of care. Assisting with better care would increase patient satisfaction as well as safety and equality for all races. Nurses and healthcare personnel can use this information to advocate and promote better quality of care for neonates of minority groups. "
Urban or Rural? The Risks for Intimate Partner Violence,"Gironda, Hanarose; Tempel, Ellyssa; Woods, Annie; Burkholder, Stephanie; Kukulski, Melissa","Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a critical issue within the United States. According to the CDC as of 2010 one in four women experience intimate partner violence each year. Initmate partner violence is defined as “actual or threatened psychological, physical, or sexual harm by a current or former partner or spouse” (Weil, 2022). IPV victims lack resources in both rural and urban areas. These include limitations to support systems, stigma of abuse, transportation barriers, and geographical isolation. Building relationships with healthcare providers and organizations can lead to an increased trust from victims, increased reporting from survivors, and providing victims with the necessary resources they need (Rural Health Information, 2021). The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to examine if women in the United States are at higher risk for IPV in rural areas compared to urban areas. The results of this review may provide insight into which geographic areas are more susceptible to intimate partner violence. Nurses and other healthcare providers can use this information to be more aware of the prevalence of IPV in their areas, to take the steps to perform proper screening, and to reach out for resources for victims.

The Effects of Stress Management Education on Registered Nurses,"Church, Cassandra; Kukulski, Melissa","Nurses in the United States are experiencing occupational stress at alarming rates. The COVID-19 pandemic and staffing shortages have only worsened stress for nurses and have acted as fuel for a vicious cycle; the more nurses that experience stress, the more that leave jobs, which further increases stress on remaining nurses in the field (ANA, 2020). The purpose of this EBP project is to explore the benefits of stress management programs for registered nurses as compared to nurses who receive little to no stress education. Existing randomized controlled trials have utilized in person training of varying lengths (1-6 weeks) and used online surveys to collect results. Nurses who receive stress management training reported lower rates of anxiety, depression, and occupational stress after completion of the education program. Based on the findings of this research, there is a clear positive effect on stress symptoms when nurses go through stress education programs, although positive results have been shown to slowly be diminished by six months after program completion This research can help guide hospitals to understand the benefits for implementation which can potentially decrease nurse turnover. Addressing how to sustain long-term effects of stress management should guide future research. "
Behavioral Effects of Diabetes Self-Management Education on Adults with Type 2 Diabetes,"Meisner-Kelley, Kendra; Kukulski, Melissa","There is an estimated 37.3 million Americans living with diabetes (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022). Most adults living with diabetes manage their day-to-day care and rely on the healthcare system for support and guidance. Diabetes Self-Management Education (DSME) can be an effective tool for educating adults with type 2 diabetes to improve self-care behaviors and improve outcomes. Unfortunately, it is estimated that less than 7% of newly diagnosed adults with type 2 diabetes receive DSME (Funnell & Piatt, 2017). Without quality management of diabetes, patients are at increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, kidney and renal diseases, and vision loss (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). This has a significant impact on healthcare costs. On average, people with diabetes have medical costs that are 2.3 times higher than those without diabetes (American Diabetes Association, 2022). Nurses and healthcare professionals can implement DSME programs to improve the outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes, improve quality of life among patients and their families, and reduce healthcare cost within the community. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effectiveness of Diabetic Self-Management Education on improving diabetes related self-care behaviors. "
