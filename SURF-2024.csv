Natalie Powell,Anthrozoology,Pseudo Narcotic Generalization in Canines,"Dogs have around three hundred million olfactory receptors in their brains (Purina, 2023)- resulting in their incredible ability to detect illegal narcotics, bed bugs, cancer, seizures, diabetes, and even explosives and ammunition. While “true material” is highly sought after for narcotic, explosive, and human remains detection, this material is often too expensive and difficult to obtain. In addition, true material presents trouble with handling, storage, and security (Front. Vet. Sci., June 2020). Due to the aforementioned concerns, pseudo odors become invaluable training aids. To effectively recreate the odor, pseudo odors are designed with the primary compound from the true material or capture the headspace of the true material to provide an effective and safe odor for canines and their handlers. This provides a similar odor profile which can provide a suitable training aid (Front. Vet. Sci., June 2020). However, more recent studies have shown a lack of generalization from pseudos to true material (Moser et al., 2019). This causes concern for canines solely using pseudos for training purposes. This study aims to gain new insight into generalization in canines from pseudo cocaine to the primary compound in cocaine (methyl benzoate) without prior training on the odor."
Bersabeh Zellele,Health Science,"Physiological and mental health effects of the ongoing civil war among North, Northwestern and Central Ethiopia","The Ethiopian civil war that erupted in November 2020 has led to a humanitarian crisis marked by displacement, loss of life, and food shortages, impacting North and Central Ethiopia. This systematic review, comprising 14 selected articles from an initial pool of 26, investigates mental health effects and physiological presentations in conflict-affected populations. Results indicate a significant prevalence of mental health disorders, especially PTSD and perceived stress, with alarming rates in specific regions. The ongoing conflict has adversely affected healthcare services, resulting in low vaccination rates, non-functional health facilities, and increased infectious diseases, including pulmonary tuberculosis.
This systematic review underscores the urgent need for interventions addressing mental health challenges in Ethiopia's conflict-affected regions, emphasizing the multifaceted impact of the war on both mental health and infectious disease prevalence."
"Juliette Crichton, Kylie Kuga, Kaden Kastner",Biology,Injury History and its Effects on the Metabolic Profile of Human Platelet-Poor Plasma,"In this advanced research experiment, metabolites in Platelet Poor Plasma (PPP) were extracted and analyzed between two cohorts; patients with previous injury and patients without previous injury. This experiment is aimed to aid healthcare professionals in facilitating better patient care and elevate the current understanding of metabolites within the field of orthopedics. PPP is a readily available byproduct found in humans, making it an advantageous medium to explore as it relates to healing and increased treatment effectiveness. It was hypothesized that differences in metabolic profile would exist between those cohorts based on the body's previous need to respond to trauma or lack thereof, especially in those metabolites necessary for regeneration. Metabolite extraction was performed in labs and then sent to Montana State University for Liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy. The resulting identified metabolites were then uploaded into Metaboanalyst where univariate and multivariate analysis were performed to determine if there were statistically significant differences between cohorts. These analyses were then run through pathway enrichment to identify the specific metabolites and metabolic pathways important in PPP."
"Lance Greany, Ryan Croft, Griffin Teuber, Robert Wigton, Connor O’Hara, Cole Greany",Business: Management & Marketing,Ten Mile Creek Brewery Process Optimization using Six Sigma Methods,"Using the D-M-A-I-C Six Sigma methodology of Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control, our project is working with the Ten Mile Creek Brewery to optimize the processes associated with beer sales in their taproom as well as beer distribution. With the introduction of new alcoholic beverages, breweries have had a hard time retaining market share. In addition, after the Covid-19 pandemic, consumer behaviors have changed to consuming less beer by switching to alternatives such as hard seltzers, teas, kombuchas, and ciders, and are less likely to visit taprooms. Our goals are to reduce variability and inefficiencies in the brewing process."
"Tessa Hoover, Elizabeth Heuiser, Marlisa Meijerink",Nursing,The cognitive impact of concussions,"Concussions are an increasing concern amongst the general population. They can arise from falls, motor vehicle accidents, and even sports injuries. Concussions pose a major threat to cognitive function, especially in the developing brain. Individuals under the age of 24 years old are at increased risk for concussions and the resulting implications of them due to their brain being underdeveloped. Vital cognitive functions such as attention span, recalling information, and memory can be impaired and negatively impact that individual’s life. The purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to explore how having a history of concussions as a young adult affects cognitive function compared to those without. Nurses and other healthcare providers can use this information to improve care of patients who face cognitive deficits because of previous concussions and implement concussion screening tools earlier in the high-risk young adult population to promote healthy brain development."
Anna Brown,English,Y’all Let’s Look at Some of These Words!,"What is the importance of studying dialects? Dialects are specific forms of language that are particular to a region or culture. While dialects influence the way we speak, they also reveal the culture and history of a language and how it developed based on the different regions the same language was spoken. The following project focuses on my dialect, which is a mix of Southern English Dialect and Western English Dialect. This comes largely from my growing up in Western Washington, but the Southern influences from my family. This project reveals what influences the way that we speak, how we can identify those influences, and what that reveals about our history and culture."
"Kaiden Romney, Benjamin Held",Biology,Analysis of the Effects of Ashwagandha on Reactive Oxygen Species in Tetrahymena thermophila,"Ashwagandha is a widely used homeopathic “adaptogen” with a myriad of advertised health benefits but little scientific evidence to support these claims. One proposed benefit is the reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) through the action of the antioxidant, withanolide. ROSs are particularly dangerous to cells due to their ability to cause DNA damage and antioxidants help to repair this damage. For this research study, it was hypothesized that the antioxidant properties of Ashwagandha would reduce ROSs and prevent DNA damage in Tetrahymena thermophila that were exposed to the environmental stressor, UV-B light. To determine the effects of Ashwagandha on ROS-induced T. thermophila, expression of the genes UBC13 and CCP1 was measured as indicators of conjugation and ROS degradation, respectively. Furthermore, behavioral assays were conducted to monitor replication, feeding, and movement, all of which are indicators of metabolic rate and health. To test our hypothesis, T. thermophila were cultured in media either with or without Ashwagandha for 24 hours and then exposed to UV-B light to induce oxidative stress. Cell growth was monitored over the course of the 48-hour treatment period while cell metabolism and motility were measured at the end. Reverse Transcription quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to measure UBC13 and CCP1 expression. The presence of Ashwagandha in UV-B treated T. thermophila cultures was predicted to aid in their growth, metabolism, and motility, while also decreasing the expression of UBC13 and CCP1, all of which are indicative of cells with less ROS damage."
"Emma Chaffin, Bella Chalmers",Psychology,The Impact of Sleep on Creativity,"High-quality sleep is essential for the brain's full cognitive functioning (Sewell et al.,(2023). It is common for students to struggle with the motivation needed to complete academic tasks when they need more sleep (Edens, 2006). Research has also shown a lack of sleep decreases cognitive function and thus hurts academic performance (Buboltz et al., 2009). In this experiment, the quality of a participant’s sleep is hypothesized to influence their level of creativity, thus influencing their score on the Remote Associates Test (RAT).  The RAT evaluates the creativity of participants by gauging how well they can take two separate elements and put them together to create a solution (Mednick, 1962). Participants consisting of Carroll College students ages 18-26 were asked to complete the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and then the RAT. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a widely used self-reported questionnaire designed to assess sleep quality over a 1-month interval. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh developed it to evaluate various aspects of sleep, including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and daytime dysfunction (Buysee et al., 1989). The scores were separated into two groups, good sleepers, and bad sleepers, and the average RAT scores were compared. While there was a visible difference between the groups, it was not statistically significant, confirming the null hypothesis. Results from this experiment suggest that college students of typical age are less affected by poor sleep than the general population."
Tyler Dailey,Chemistry,Studies Toward Isolation and Characterization of Aminated Nickel(II) Hydrate Intermediates,"Metal-ligand coordination complexes are formed by step-wise ligand substitutions when ligands are introduced to metal ions. However, it is common for only the final product to be isolated in these types of reactions. Herein, a proposed ligand-exchange method for isolating and quantifying the stoichiometry of the intermediates of the nickel(II) hexahydrate to nickel(II) hexamine reaction is reported. The ligand-exchange method applied held the molar concentration of nickel(II) hexahydrate constant while varying molar ratios of reacting amine. Under these controlled conditions, stable isolated nickel(II) n-ammonia n-hydrate intermediate species were produced at all mole ratios investigated, whereas the nickel(II) hexamine was only formed under excess reacting ammonia. Stoichiometries of the aminated intermediate species were measured using UV-vis spectroscopic analysis due to the color difference between the hydrated and aminated species in an aqueous environment. The wavelength at which the hydrated species' absorbance was highest (?max) was 394nm, and the ?max of the aminated species was 363nm. The isolated aminated intermediate species blue-shifted 5nm from the hexahydrate reactant species. From this, the intermediate species stoichiometry was determined to be 1:1.5, water ligands to ammonia ligands, coordinated to the nickel(II) center."
"Margaret Todd, Ariannah Sargent",Environmental Science,Charcoal and Macrofossil Record of Lake Helena,"This study is a preliminary assessment of the vegetation and fire history obtained from sediment cores from the bottom of Lake Helena, near Helena, Montana. Before it was dammed in the early 1900’s, the land surface under Lake Helena consisted of creeks, wetlands, and springs which were discovered through historical maps and exploratory sediment cores. Previous cores from the lake have provided a paleoenvironmental record going back at least 7,000 years. Using new cores obtained in January of 2024, we tested the sediments to determine if an adequately preserved record of plant macrofossils and charcoal exists. The sediment cores were split and physical characteristics were described. Then, using the initial description, we utilized targeted sampling intervals within the core to extract material for charcoal and macro fossils analysis, as well as radiocarbon dating. This initial assessment provides a preliminary record of plant macrofossils and charcoal which inform the subsequent higher resolution sampling for the full study. This analysis of the vegetation surrounding Lake Helena, coupled with future analysis of pollen count, diatoms, and charcoal, as well as radiocarbon dating, will allow us to reconstruct aspects of paleoclimate surrounding the lake and therefore gain a better understanding of the paleoclimate of the greater Helena Valley."
"Jensen Keller, Jaymee Sheridan, Stephanie Smith",Nursing,"In women that are pregnant, how does vaginal delivery compared to cesarean section delivery affect breastfeeding success?","Breastfeeding is crucial for both maternal and infant health, and various aspects can influence its success. One significant factor under examination is the mode of delivery; vaginal or cesarean section. This abstract reviews existing literature to explore the impact of delivery style on breastfeeding success. There are many factors from both delivery modes that impact the success of breastfeeding as well as the recovery of the mother. While cesarean sections are sometimes medically necessary, efforts to support breastfeeding initiation and continuation in this population can be challenging. Whereas breastfeeding after vaginal delivery, makes for a smoother and more successful transition to breastfeeding. Further research is warranted to highlight the relationship between delivery mode and breastfeeding outcomes. Interventions for successful breastfeeding initiation and duration for mothers and infants are important to help optimize their overall holistic health."
Zach Rector,Health Science,Ozempic & Weight Loss Outcomes for Type 2 Diabetes Patients,"Objective: To review studies conducted on the Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) treatment Ozempic in comparison to traditional treatments, with the variables measured being average HbA1c and weight loss. Methods: Literature was gathered primarily through PubMed, with an emphasis on studies examining Ozempic in contrast to other T2D treatments. Dosage level effectiveness of Ozempic, efficacy in comparison to other treatments, and success over a given period were examined. Results: Ozempic was more effective at reducing average HbA1C and weight of trial participants in comparison to traditional treatments, such as insulin therapy and Lixisenatide. Tirzapeptide, a T2D treatment released in 2023, was more effective than Ozempic for reducing average HbA1C and weight in T2D patients in two trials.  Conclusion: Ozempic was found to be more effective than traditional treatments for T2D in terms of HbA1C and average weight reduction. Further research should be conducted comparing the efficacy of Trizapeptide in comparison to Ozempic."
Sydney Gannon,Health Science,Comparison of Prenatal and Postnatal Treatment of Myelomeningocele: A Systematic Review,"Objective: To review relevant literature concerning the impact of prenatal repair of myelomeningocele on overall infant and maternal health, compared to postnatal repair of myelomeningocele.Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed and CINAHL and assessed for long- and short-term effects of prenatal and postnatal repair of myelomeningocele on infant and maternal health. Results: Prenatal repair was associated with significant health and functionality improvements in later childhood compared to postnatal repair, but it was also correlated with increased pre-labor risks for both mother and child. Conclusions: While unique, individual features such as lesion size have an impact on the suggested treatment of myelomeningocele, current research suggests that prenatal repair is associated with more positive long-term health than postnatal repair; however, this treatment comes with the risk of complications in the pre-labor stages. The interventions mentioned in this review should be further researched to provide additional treatment options."
"Hannah Ziegenhagen, Emma Stachofsky, Andrea Robinson",Nursing,Early Intervention Chronic Kidney Disease,"Many people at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD) do not recognize risk factors or have awareness of modifiable lifestyle changes that could prevent or slow the progression of CKD. Chronic kidney disease is a serious and irreversible condition that requires lifelong treatment of dialysis. This treatment can create barriers in everyday life and lower overall life expectancy. The purpose of this evidence based practice brief is to determine if free yearly urine albumin to creatinine ratio (uACR) tests at screening and preventive events can reduce progression of CKD by helping with early diagnosis in those with risk factors. The uACR test is one method used to measure the functionality of the kidneys which is indicative of CKD, as decreased kidney function correlates with further progression. The results of this research may reduce the rates of CKD progression by screening more people with CKD risk factors. Offering this resource gives the opportunity to diagnose and treat the disease before dialysis is required, potentially slowing its progression and reducing the need for dialysis."
Gabrielle Sheridan,Public Health,Period Products on Montana Campuses,"Poverty impacts people’s ability to afford many essentials, including menstrual products, and this can be especially challenging for college students already rationing their money. Research indicates that 14.2% of college women have experienced period poverty within the past year, while 48% have encountered difficulties accessing menstrual products due to financial constraints.(Gruer,C) Additionally, nearly 19% have had to prioritize menstrual products over other essential expenses.(Jaafar, H) In response to this issue, colleges across the United States, including institutions in Montana, have initiated efforts to provide tampons and pads in campus restrooms. This research examines how colleges in Montana have begun offering tampons and pads by collecting data from three colleges in Montana. At each location, data on products in restrooms was recorded. Additionally,information on the funding mechanisms and distribution management of these products was collected. The majority of institutions provide some form of period product support to students and others on their campuses. The findings underscore the widespread recognition of the importance of addressing menstrual hygiene accessibility in educational institutions. The prevalence and absence of these practices is analyzed across institutions in order to determine which institutions are likely to provide products and their associated benefits.

"Alyssa Hurst, Peyton Wimmer",Biochemistry,The Effects of Elderberry on DNA Damage and Repair in Tetrahymena thermophila,"The homeopathic supplement, Elderberry extract, has been marketed as an antioxidant that reduces DNA-damaging free radicals within the body to protect the structural integrity of tissues. However, very little research has been done to support the effectiveness of Elderberry’s antioxidant properties in protecting tissues from DNA damage. For this research project, we explored how elderberry influences behavior and expression of the DNA repair genes, Rad51 and Ku80, in Tetrahymena thermophila. It was hypothesized that UV-B exposed T. thermophila treated with elderberry would exhibit increased expression of Rad51 and Ku80 because antioxidants have been shown to play a significant role in DNA repair and replication. To test our hypothesis, T. thermophila was subjected to UV-B light to induce DNA damage and then treated with elderberry to investigate its protective effects. Following treatment, Reverse Transcription--quantitative -Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to measure the expression of Rad51 and Ku80. Additionally, three behavioral assays were conducted to determine the impacts of elderberry treatment on cell growth, metabolic activity, and motility within the T. thermophila. The treatment of UV-B exposed T. thermophila with elderberry was predicted to increase expression of Rad51 and Ku80 and improve their growth, metabolic activity, and motility.  This is because antioxidants such as elderberry are thought to play an essential role in facilitating the removal of excess free radical oxygen species to either prevent or help repair DNA damage."
Aidan Scott,Health Science,"Brain to Computer Interface (BCI) Enhancement of Stroke Rehabilitation, a Systematic Review","Objective: To review literature on the use of Brain to Computer Interface (BCI) technology to optimize stroke rehabilitation. Methods: Published research was gathered through PubMed and Google Scholar, that assessed the impact of BCI intervention, including soft glove BCI robotics, motor imagery (MI) enhanced with BCI, haptic knob (HK) robotic arm, and exoskeleton with BCI. Results: The majority of research supported the use of novel BCI based technologies to enhance the stroke rehabilitation process. Many articles had small sample sizes. Conclusions: The use of BCI based technologies is a growing and promising field to help treat the growing number of stroke patients. Because of the small group sizes, further research is needed to confirm significant results."
"Sarah Rounds-Reenalda, Chayton Winkle, Dagimn Degaro, Elijah Larson, Juan Muniz Navarrete, Logan Hill",Business: Management & Marketing,Parish Audit,"We are using the DMAIC Six Sigma methodology to improve the auditing process within the Helena Dioceses Parishes. Lack of resources, inefficiencies, communication gaps, as well as limited expertise and staff have led to non-standardized and incomplete audits. These issues could potentially expose the Dioceses to fraud, loss, liability, and improper use of church funds. Our goals are to design an audit process with reduced variation in the parish auditing process and improve the schedule."
"Addie Butler, Delaney Hasquet, Ellie Koerber",Nursing,How Does Intrapartum COVID-19 Affect Neonatal Outcomes?,"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) virus led to a pandemic that changed procedures, protocols, and health outcomes of patients of all ages. The effects of COVID-19 on the neonates born to mothers with the virus is an emerging topic in neonatal nursing. COVID-19 has effects on not only the infected mother, but the neonate after birth. It is hypothesized that neonates born to mothers who had COVID-19 during pregnancy have more negative health outcomes than neonates whose mothers did not have COVID-19 during pregnancy. Prevention and early detection are essential in mothers infected with COVID-19 as well as early intervention for the neonates born to these mothers. The purpose of this evidence-based review is to determine the effects of intrapartum COVID-19 on neonates. Nursing practice would benefit from implementation of an assessment standard for pregnant women and neonates whose mothers had COVID-19 during their pregnancy. Identifying COVID-19 in pregnancy can prepare nurses to assess neonates after birth for signs of complications and provide early intervention in order to treat neonatal morbidities and prevent mortality."
Nathan Stalder,Anthrozoology,Impact of Animal-Assisted Therapy on Psychological Well-being,"At the turn of the century, animals became increasingly popular in mental health treatments such as psychiatric disorders. Studies denote the numerous health benefits of these animals on patients, leading to the integration of Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) in psychiatric treatment programs. This systematic review includes randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled studies, and observational studies with control groups published in the last 20 years. Studies are peer-reviewed, and report on AAT interventions among psychiatric inpatients. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of animal-assisted therapy (AAT) in improving mental health outcomes across various psychiatric disorders in diverse in-patient populations, including children, adolescents, and adults, focusing on measurable improvements in psychiatric symptoms, social functioning, and quality of life indicators. The findings suggest that AAT has the potential of being a beneficial adjunctive treatment for improving mental health outcomes in psychiatric in-patient across all patient demographics. These results underscore the potential for integrating AAT into existing therapeutic modalities, offering a complementary approach that leverages the unique benefits of the human-animal bond."
"Hunter Wetherelt, Hunter Smith",Biology,The effects of Bryonia alba on oxidative stress in Tetrahymena thermophila,"In recent years, the market for homeopathic supplements has experienced drastic growth despite the fact that it remains unregulated. An example of a supplement that has grown in popularity is Bryonia alba, which is derived from a flower located in Europe and is said to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. For this study, we focused on the antioxidant properties of Bryonia alba due to its flavin molecules that have been shown to relieve oxidative stress. It was hypothesized that Tetrahymena thermophila cells exposed to an oxidative stressor and treated with Bryonia alba would remain healthier and have altered expression of the RAD51 and OXR1 genes compared to untreated cells. The Rad51 gene was chosen for its role in DNA repair while OXR1 served as an indicator for oxidative stress resistance.  To test the antioxidant properties of Bryonia alba, we exposed T. thermophila to hydrogen peroxide and treated them with either the Bryonia extract or a control solution. Following treatment, behavioral assays were performed to evaluate changes in cell viability, metabolic function, and motility, while expression of Rad51 and OXR1 was measured by Real-Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR).  It was predicted that T. thermophila exposed to oxidative stress and treated with Bryonia alba would have better motility, increased metabolic function, and improved growth compared to untreated cells.  Expression of RAD51 and OXR1 was also predicted to be higher in the Bryonia alba treated cells, indicating they were better able to respond to the oxidative damage caused by hydrogen peroxide."
"Geri Cutler, Elissa Mazkour",Neuroscience,"Effects of the Magnesium Supplement, Calm, on Climbing, Wall following, and Aggression in Drosophila melanogaster","In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the accessibility and popularity of homeopathic supplements; however, the benefits these supplements claim to provide and their safety have not been thoroughly studied.  Prior research has shown that magnesium supplements may be used as an alternative to melatonin to boost energy, improve anxiety symptoms, and improve sleep and memory. To determine whether or not magnesium supplements provide the benefits they claim, the effects of the magnesium supplement, Calm, on behaviors of the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster, were analyzed. It was hypothesized that if Drosophila melanogaster were exposed to Calm for one week, they would be able to climb further, spend less time wall following, and be more aggressive; behaviors that correspond to increased energy, improved anxiety symptoms, and better sleep. The results of this study showed that the Calm treated flies climbed significantly further and spent less time engaging in wall following behaviors; however, they did not exhibit more aggressive behaviors. These findings support Calm’s claim of improving energy and anxiety symptoms; however, they do not support Calm’s claim of improving sleep-related behaviors."
Charlie Markham,Chemistry,Spatial and risk assessment of metal contaminants in an acid mine drainage affected region of central Montana,"A 1996 water quality investigation by the Montana DEQ identified concentrations of arsenic and mercury exceeding the human health and aquatic life standards in Silver Creek (Marysville, Montana). While the findings indicated Silver Creek did not support aquatic life nor drinking water use, minimal reclamation efforts were made. To assess the current conditions of Silver Creek, surface water and bed sediment samples were collected at six different locations spanning the creek over the course of a month in the summer of 2023. The samples were tested for fifteen environmentally relevant trace metal contaminants by Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-OES). Sample collection, preservation, and testing were performed according to EPA standards and procedures. The surface water was found to have ten of the fifteen metals above the EPA region III acceptable freshwater screening limits; with Pb, Cd and Be concentrations also exceeding the EPA drinking water standards. The freshwater sediment screening limits were exceeded for eight metals; of note, the bioaccumulating metals, As and Pb, were found to be ten times higher than their acceptable concentration levels. Further anthropogenic mitigation studies will be tested to determine if conditions hinder the leaching of metals from the Silver Creek sediment."
Robert Hague,Health Science,Supplementation of dietary sugars with non-nutritive sugars increases insulin sensitivity in patients with type II diabetes. ,"Objective: To review relevant literature regarding the consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners as an alternative to dietary sugars to help manage type II diabetes. Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed and CINAHL in early 2024. Studies were reviewed to assess the effects that consumption of non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS) have on insulin resistance and blood sugar levels, when compared to dietary sugars. Results: The reviewed literature found that non-nutritive sweeteners can be used to help manage diabetes. Common NNS like aspartame and acesulfame resulted in small metabolic responses, leading to minimal increases in free insulin and blood sugar levels, when compared to physiological responses to dietary sugars. Conclusions: The use of NNS to manage insulin resistance in individuals with type II diabetes is possible. However, the studies reviewed were mostly short-term trials, there may be negative long-term side effects from longer uses of NNS. Given the increasing global burden of diabetes, further research on NNS is warranted. Keywords: non-nutritive sweeteners; sweetening agents; artificial sweeteners; type II diabetes; randomized controlled trial."
Taylor Costales,Nursing,The Effects of Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) on Dementia Symptoms,"Dementia is prevalent worldwide with over 55 million people with a current diagnosis of dementia. Dementia is defined as “the impaired ability to remember, think, or make decisions” and is not a normal part of the aging process. Treatment may include Dance Movement Therapy (DMT) which is “the psychotherapeutic use of movement to promote emotional, social, cognitive, and physical integration of the individual, for the purpose of improving health and well-being”. DMT improves cognitive ability, daily functioning, and psychosocial functioning if the patient is consistent with participation in the DMT. The purpose of this Evidenced-Based review is to examine the effects that DMT can have to benefit the elderly with dementia. The outcome of the research may help dementia patients improve their quality of life and contribute to the holistic care of the person. Nurses can use this information to promote and organize DMT interventions to help dementia patients improve function, have socialization, and cognition."
"Gracelyn Dunlap, Kinley Hamilton, Deanna Lord",Special Education,Understanding the Factors Contributing to the Special Education Teacher Shortage,"The shortage of certified special education staff is a pressing issue, impacting the quality of support for students with diverse learning needs. We are researching why there is a lack of certified special education teachers. The main question we want to answer is, “Would knowing why there is a lack of certified special education teachers help us figure out how to improve conditions to reverse this pressing issue?” Our research methods include the use of Google Scholar, Carroll College’s Library Catalog, the ERIC database, and peer-reviewed articles. Through our research, we determined several main issues that contribute to the special education teacher shortage. Special Education teachers experience unmanageable workloads as their working conditions are not always ideal. Licensed Special Education teachers have tiring work environments including their tasking job assignments, large classes, general job stress, paperwork, lack of empowerment in the workplace, and the overall school climate. Often, they have too little time to plan and manage their workload effectively. Stress, exhaustion, burnout, and isolation come as a result of these large demands and lack of administrative support. Along with these issues, special education teachers do not always see their student’s progress, which can lead to unmotivated and decreased feelings of accomplishment. This research can be used to combat the certified special education teacher shortage by specifically attempting to address the issues that are leading to high teacher attrition rates."
"Jesse Windle, Elaina Patten, Jasmine Pearson",Nursing,Mindfulness As an Intervention For Compassion Fatigue and Burnout in Patient-care Nurses,"Compassion fatigue is a significant challenge currently facing nurses. Characteristically seen in nurses who, in their effort to provide care, alleviate suffering, and advocate for clients, become too overwhelmed to continue in the profession. These nurses tend to experience a decline in mental and physical health and overall well-being. While compassion fatigue can affect all nurses, the population this project will focus on are those involved in direct patient care. The demands on patient care nurses vary but high workloads, constant exposure to stress and traumatic events, and care for multiple patients, all exert a high amount of social and professional pressure upon them. This reality gets lost in promoting and maintaining patient health and safety. However, it is just as important to care for the health and safety of every nurse. To promote resilience, combat burnout, and facilitate sustainable nursing practices, some institutions have implemented resiliency initiatives that utilize mindfulness as a core component. While mindfulness can have several definitions, in this paper it involves a diversity of practices that aim to improve emotional balance, clarify a sense of purpose, and enhance overall wellbeing. The intent of implementing these mindfulness interventions is to help alleviate the stress that patient care nurses experience daily and reduce the rate of nurse burnout throughout the profession. This research paper reviews several studies that explore the impact of mindfulness as an effective intervention against compassion fatigue, specifically in client care nurses."
Anika Bjornson,Sociology,"Impacts of Societal Body Standards: A Study on the Interplay Between Social Media, Eating Disorders, and Depression in Adolescents with Type 1 Diabetes","Hundreds of new social media platforms have launched reaching record highs of active followers, since social media's first breakthrough in 2004 when MySpace reached one million active users (Our World in Data, 2024). With the influence of social media, adolescents are at a greater risk for developing dysregulated eating habits and comorbidities, such as depression, than any other generation (Bor et al., 2014; Chung et al. 2021). However, adolescents diagnosed with type one diabetes (T1D)  are exposed to more risk factors, leading to double the prevalence of mental health disparities, compared to healthy peers (Hood et al. 2006; Polonsky & Fortmann 2020; Ripoli et al. 2022; Whittemore et al. 2002). Research on contemporary concerns has revealed that increased use of social media is associated with poorer sleep quality, diminished self-worth, feelings of loneliness, and unrealistic comparison of body standards in youth (Alonzo et al. 2019; Gupta & Sharma 2021; Lee et al. 2023; Oberst et al. 2016; Weinstein 2017). The broad consensus in coexisting literature has shown poor body image in T1D adolescents is negatively influenced by variables like body weight and engagement in social media involvement (Verbist & Condon 2019). The purpose of this study is to examine how societal expectations through social media contribute to the development of eating disorders and depression in T1D adolescents. Erving Goffman's framing theory is used to identify which frames are employed amongst popular social media posts, enabling the identification of which sociological frameworks are being manipulated. This study aims to determine if modern dilemmas are an additional risk factor for T1D adolescents’ mental health. "
"Emilie Turpen, Miya Nettleton, Aubrey Baker",Nursing,The Effect of Opioids and Cannabis on Pain Management,"Amidst the ongoing opioid crisis, many have turned to cannabis to modulate their pain needs. This shift is partially due to the negative connotation of opioid abuse and the risk for addiction that opioids carry. As we move forward in this new climate, both modalities must be evaluated. Both chemicals interact with receptors in our body to reduce pain but use different mechanisms to produce this effect. Part of the challenge associated with pain relief is that it is often measured quantitatively via subjective information provided by the patient. Opioids, such as morphine and oxycodone, are highly effective narcotics that effectively relieve pain for patients. However, there is a high risk of addiction and misuse associated with opioid prescriptions. Cannabis is often used as an alternative to opioids for pain management. Additionally, considering the controversy concerning complex cannabis legalities, it is imperative to understand the potential risks associated with its use. The purpose of this evidence-based practice review is to explore the benefit-risk ratio of cannabis and opioid use separately and concurrently in the context of addiction and effective pain management. As nurses and providers enter this new landscape of pain modulation options, it is important that they are informed of the various methods available to patients, as well as accurately educate patients on risks and benefits associated with different treatment modalities."
Kaitlyn Hansen,Anthrozoology,Does Age Affect Learning in Cats,"Currently, there is very little published research denoting the effect of age on learning in felines. This case study was conducted as a proof of concept, and we found there was a difference in learning between younger and older cats. A four and a half month old cat and an eight year old cat were trained for approximately nine months, excluding school breaks. Differences in learning speed and command interpretation were noted and compared. Major differences were found between the two cats, but we are unable to conclude whether the difference was age, personality, sex or some other unknown factor due to the small sample size. Based on the results of this study, we feel it is necessary to conduct more intensive research which would benefit veterinarians, shelter workers, and cat trainers."
Conner Bawden,Health Science,How Dry Needling Affects Quality of Life in Individuals Who Are Experiencing Lower Back Pain: A Systematic Review,"Objective: To review the current literature on the effectiveness of dry needling and how it affects the quality of life of individuals experiencing lower back pain.

"Kaitlynn Ayers, Sydney Gannon, Hunter Smith, Hunter Wetherelt",Biology,Impact of Natural Water Sources on Algal Biodiversity: A Comparison of Lakes and Creeks,"The nutrient content and flow rate of water sources impact the growth and diversity of the microbial species they host. This experiment analyzes how biodiversity of aquatic algae and cyanobacterial communities is affected by different natural water sources, including both lakes and streams, local to Helena. The results of this experiment provide insight into the nutrient content and overall health of local aquatic ecosystems. Four local sources of water were compared: Prickly Pear Creek, Canyon Ferry Lake, Spring Meadow Lake, and tap water as a control. Water samples were filtered to remove existing microorganisms then algal samples from Canyon Ferry Lake were added and left to grow for two weeks. Phosphate and nitrate tests were also performed on the four water samples. Samples were then analyzed for microbial community diversity using 16S rRNA gene sequencing with MinION technology, and patterns community composition were analyzed using MicrobiomeAnalyst. 214,124 reads were classified and showed that Canyon Ferry had the greatest alpha diversity at the phylum level, followed by Spring Meadow, Prickly Pear, and tap water. The data for genus level diversity was not statistically significant with a p-value of 0.181.This research can be expanded by investigating the effect of varying nutrient levels on microorganism diversity at each site over the course of a year. With this data, a better understanding of the local bodies of water is gained and can be used to improve land management practices and wastewater management in the Helena area."

"Avery Tripp, Laura Ley, Catherine Mack",Nursing,Alcohol Prescription Compared to Pharmacotherapy in Alcoholic Patients,"The purpose of this evidenced-based review is to examine how alcohol prescription, compared to pharmacotherapy, affects healing time for those with alcohol abuse disorder (AUD) during the hospital stay. The problem is relevant for Montana healthcare professionals as alcoholism is a public health issue. Deciding which intervention to implement creates a challenge because both methods have pros and cons. It is crucial to examine both objective and subjective data when looking at this population because addiction has both psychological and psychological components. This being so, it is important for licensed healthcare providers to deliver evidenced-based care in treating those with this diagnosis. Comparing and contrasting research will make it possible to create an environment where the best outcome can be achieved for those with AUD. Whether it be pharmacotherapy or alcohol prescription in the hospital setting, the optimal goal should be to decrease cravings and withdrawal symptoms, improve quality of life and healthcare outcomes, and promote individualized care."
Hank Rugg,Data Science,Machine Learning for Sports Betting,"With sports betting becoming more widely legal, the use of machine learning algorithms for improving an individual’s odds of placing successful sport bets have increased. In general, applying machine learning algorithms comes with challenges such as data selection, feature engineering, and dealing with time series data. In the context of gambling, it also comes with ethical considerations such as the use of such models to gamble, the accuracy of the model, and transparency of the model. This research focuses specifically on predicting the total combined score of NBA games. This is directly applicable to the over/under bet – over if you believe the combined total score will be above the number set by the sports book and under if you believe the combined score will be less than the number set by the sports book. The goal of this research is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the total combined score of NBA games and consider the ethical use of the model."
Zoie Koci,Health Science,Arthroscopic Hip Surgery versus Non-Operative Physical Therapy to Repair Acetabular Labral Tears,"Objective: To review current literature regarding arthroscopic hip surgery versus nonoperative physical therapy for treating acetabular tears, comparing recovering time, pain levels, and time it takes to return to sport. Methods: Literature was collected through PubMed, Google Scholar, and CINAHL in the fall of 2023, looking at arthroscopic surgery and nonoperative physical therapy. Advanced searches included acetabular tears in athletes, arthroscopic labral reconstruction, and physical therapy to repair torn labrums. Results: The reviewed literature supported arthroscopic hip surgery in comparison to nonoperative physical therapy to yield better recovery, less pain, and a faster return to sport in individuals with acetabular tears. There were no negative long-term effects from arthroscopic hip surgery. Arthroscopic surgery to repair the labrum also reduced the chances of having the labrum re-tear and decreased the need for open hip surgery. Conclusions: In individuals with acetabular labral tears, arthroscopic hip surgery is more effective and gives better results than nonoperative physical therapy. The surgery did not have any negative impacts on the patients, and yielded quicker recovery time, less pain over a long period of time, and less time out of the sport. "
"Payton West, Weston Mitchum",Nursing,Acupressure Therapy Impact on Chemotherapy-induced Nausea and Vomiting,"Comfort care for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment is a main concern for the patients and families, but it is also a large focal point for the nurses caring for them. Chemotherapy can lead to a variety of unpleasant side effects. Specifically, uncontrolled nausea and vomiting resulting from the chemotherapy treatment is an ongoing concern. Significant nausea and vomiting may lead to additional health concerns such as fluid and electrolyte imbalances, weight loss, nutritional deficiencies, as well as metabolic changes. These health changes can have a major impact on the patient's physical and mental well-being. Chemotherapy is often a primary treatment for cancer. The purpose of this evidence-based practice brief is to examine and evaluate how acupressure compared to traditional antiemetic medication alone affects the severity and frequency of chemo-induced nausea and vomiting. The outcome of this brief may lend insight to potential evidence-based healthcare practices for cancer patients, specifically providing comfort care to patients experiencing chemo-induced nausea and vomiting. Nurses can use this information to implement the practices of advocacy, education, and protocol/policy change to provide the most effective holistic care possible to this population."
"Nathaniel Gong, Caleb Smith, Willem Trainor",Environmental Science,Associations Between Terracettes and Landscape Factors in Central Montana,"Terracettes are naturally occurring hillside formations of evenly-spaced ridges, resembling stairsteps down a slope. The ridges follow the contour of the slope and are generally smaller than a meter in width and height. Commonly assumed to be the result of livestock trails, multiple studies have suggested other causes such as solifluction, freeze-thaw processes, slope creep, and rotating slump blocks. There is significant controversy over their formation which could be due to terracettes being polygenetic in nature. Previous studies have focused on methods for identifying terracettes, yet hardly venture into formation factors, leaving a large gap in knowledge. The aim of this study is to examine whether the presence of terracettes are associated with one or more landscape factors, such as surface slope and aspect. The strength of these associations might provide insight into terracette formation. In order to control for confounding variables, a study area in Central Montana east of the Continental Divide was selected for similar climate and vegetation. All terracettes within the study area were identified using satellite imagery and mapped in ArcGIS Pro. Geologic, soil, and topographic data were then overlain. Using terracette presence data, distribution curves were derived from each factor, and additional analyses were used in an attempt to determine the strength of associations. Strong or weak associations with individual landscape factors could allow a narrowing of hypotheses regarding the spatial distribution of terracettes in Central Montana. This could provide avenues to pursue further research in determining causality. "
"Katherine Bold, Serena Keil-Hoye",Biochemistry,Annual Comparison of Microbial Communities and Nitrogen Levels,"As water is becoming an extremely scarce resource, it is critical to understand the relationship between Montana’s water resources and the effects of nitrogen on water quality. This experiment aims to characterize the relationship between microbial communities and nitrogen levels in natural and artificial water bodies across Central and Northwest Montana. Higher nitrogen levels were anticipated in artificial water bodies compared to natural bodies of water, with a corresponding difference in microbial community composition. Water samples were collected from eight locations during March 2022, October 2022, and October 2023 for chemical analysis and were sent to Energy Labs to determine nitrate and nitrite levels. October samplings also included sediment collection for microbial analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted, followed by PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene and Nanopore sequencing to determine the relative composition of bacterial groups in each sampling location. Here we present findings on patterns of microbial communities among Montana water sources in relation to nitrogen levels across two years of sample collection to address increased concerns regarding the quality of our water sources."
"Caitlyn Vermulm, Alexzandria Hutchison, Katarina Kosiewicz",Nursing,The prevalence of psychosocial health disorders in children born via cesarean section compared to vaginal deliveries,"Babies are delivered every day by either cesarean or vaginal birth. Concerning the modes of delivery, studies have shown an increased risk of neurodivergent conditions worldwide. These studies show that children born via cesarean section are more likely to have autism spectrum disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or other learning disabilities, compared to vaginal birth Healthcare providers can screen children born via cesarean delivery earlier for these disorders to provide earlier interventions and resources to the child and family. Early intervention for babies born via cesarean delivery will aid in limiting the impact of these conditions and allow children and their families to adapt to psychosocial barriers. Pediatric patients with conditions such as autism and ADHD have difficulties in social experiences as well as comprehension and learning in the classroom. Promoting awareness of the increased risk and screening of children who were born via cesarean delivery can allow for earlier diagnosis. Autism can present in multiple ways, such as language, motor, and social delays. Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) struggle with regulating concentration and restlessness. All learning disabilities can impact the child’s ability to adapt to the outside world and “keep up” with their peers socially and academically. Recognizing that children who were born via cesarean section are at increased risk for these conditions can help families mitigate these challenges. The purpose of this review is to identify and promote awareness to healthcare professionals about the increased risks for psychosocial disorders with children who are born via cesarean birth. "
Tyler Dailey,Chemistry,Synthesis and Study of Carbene Intermediates,"Carbene intermediates are of interest due to their high reactivity, use in carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions, and prevalence in interstellar space. Carbene species are found in comets, atmospheres of carbon stars, and have also been identified in cool molecular gas clouds. Further information about carbene intermediates could inform us about ion-molecular interactions and provide insight into the origin of the universe and its destiny. Applications of carbene intermediates include their use in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, plastics, and polymers used daily by consumers. This study focuses on the synthesis of sulfonium ylide precursor molecules to malonate and beta-diketone carbene intermediates of interest. Varied steric and electronic properties resulting from different substituents on the derivatives will allow for the investigation of carbene abundance and spin state distribution.  The proposed synthetic pathway includes a two-step synthesis proceeding through a diazo precursor molecule, which will then be used to form the sulfonium ylide. Upon successful synthesis of the sulfonium ylide derivatives, trapping experiments will be performed via photolysis to study the carbene intermediates of interest."
Emily Funseth,Sociology,Mental Health Among Carroll College Students,"This research study examines the relationship between sexuality, religiosity, and perceived levels of social support in relation to suicidal ideation. The data was derived from a survey that was administered to liberal arts students at a small, private, Catholic college. Existing literature suggests that LGBTQ+ students experience higher levels of suicide ideation than their heterosexual peers. The literature also proposes that although religiosity may mitigate these experiences, it also often increases feelings of internalized homophobia, ultimately leading to mental health issues in some. In terms of social support, overall perceived feelings of social support have previously been correlated to fewer experiences with suicidal ideation. This research helps to identify what factors influence suicidal ideation and may be used for intervention on college campuses or even more broadly."
"Madeline Vandehey, Brooke Vandehey, Natalie Bahou",Special Education,Recruitment and Retention of Rural Special Education Teachers: Why They Go and How to Make Them Stay,"Recruiting and retaining qualified special educators is a deficit found in rural America. This project will focus on identifying major contributing factors to teacher “burnout” such as rural America’s isolated environment and the expanded role and responsibilities placed on special education teachers. This is a highly relevant topic for preservice and in-service teachers in Montana, as Montana has a high number of rural communities in comparison to other states. Our research highlights how crucial it is to provide teachers support throughout their careers, as their knowledge, expertise, and attitude will profoundly impact the students entrusted to their care. Therefore, schools nationwide, particularly in rural areas, need to ensure they are hiring and retaining qualified special educators. The Carroll College Library database was utilized to find credible, relevant research.  We categorized, created outlines, and brainstormed together the direction our research would take. Up-to-date studies and research articles have been synthesized to determine crucial problems and potential solutions to this topic. All students, regardless of where they live, and their level of (dis)ability, deserve and have the right to a free, appropriate, enriching, and high-quality public education. This research will help educate our peers here at Carroll, particularly if they are interested in becoming rural special education teachers. It furthermore highlights an issue facing many students and teachers all across the nation - and awareness is the first step to action."
"Ezekiel Bradbury, James Normandeau",Biology,Studying Montana’s Temperature trends and Consistent Stagnant Water Supply: Predictive Analysis for Susceptibility to Malaria Outbreak,"Since June of 2023, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) has reported four cases of locally transmitted malaria in the United States. The vector for the malaria Plasmodium is the Anopheles genus mosquito. Anopheles mosquitoes are typically found in non-arboreal, palustrine wetlands, a habitat that encompasses much of the state of Montana. Given the risk due to the presence of malaria vectors in the state, this study will determine the areas of the state most susceptible to local transmission of the pathogen. We hypothesized that Anopheles's distribution would be positively correlated with higher mean annual temperatures and suitable palustrine water sources greater than 10m2. This experiment utilized 557 Anopheles sites surveyed between 2005-2019 in the state of Montana. To avoid spatial auto-correlation, sites were spatially filtered and compiled into ArcGIS, resulting in 156 replicates. A model was constructed comparing temperature or palustrine habitat availability and a Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for each variable. To capture the amount of palustrine wetland near sites, buffers of 5 kilometers were created in GIS around each mosquito site. Preliminary results suggest that there was a positive correlation between palustrine water habitat and number of Anopheles and mean annual temperature and the number of Anopheles. However, these correlations only explained 14.8% and 1.15% of the variation, respectively."
"Josie Gale, Elissa Mazkour, Elizabeth Kirby, Madelyn Franz, Marrin Chapman",Biology,Comparing Algal Diversity of Potentially Toxic Versus Nutrient-stable Environments In the Greater Helena Area,"The purpose of this experiment was to identify differences in the diversity of algal communities found in environments that have not been exposed to mining pollutants versus those environments that have been exposed to pollutants. Little research has been conducted to determine the impacts of mining on algal diversity. By examining and comparing two different water sources, we are able to elucidate the effect of toxic environments on algal growth and diversity. The main focus of this experiment is to compare the diversity of the 16s gene between a toxic environment, which has been more closely impacted by mining activity, and a more healthy environment which has not been impacted as severely by local mining. From Lake Helena and Prickly Pear Creek, three samples were collected from the respective water surfaces, deep water, and soil (five meters from the water) at each location. The samples collected were amplified via PCR and made identifiable via genomic barcodes. Any contaminants were then removed from the amplified samples. Then samples were added to a sequencing library and input into the MinION for sequencing. The completed sequences were subsequently analyzed through both Epi2me and MicrobiomeAnalyst to quantify the diversity within each sample and identify the primary genera and phyla present in the respective samples. Due to a lack of read counts corresponding to water samples, we excluded this information and focused analysis on soil samples. Our research revealed a greater phyla diversity as well as greater genera diversity present in Prickly Pear Creek soil samples as compared to Lake Helena samples. Though these findings were not statistically significant, Prickly Pear Creek appears to have a more diverse algal community than Lake Helena. In future studies, statistically significant results could be obtained by increasing the amount of samples collected as well as increasing the locations of sample collection."
"Noah Lohar, Max Peed",Biology,Investigating the Effects of Milk Thistle on Sterol Metabolism in Tetrahymena thermophila,"While homeopathic supplements have been used for thousands of years in traditional Eastern medicine, the availability of these supplements has increased dramatically within the last several decades. An area of concern is that these supplements are often sold without clinical evidence of their effectiveness or regulatory oversight from the Federal Drug Administration (FDA). This study aimed to explore the proposed hypolipidemic effects of Milk Thistle extract, also known as silymarin, on sterol metabolism in Tetrahymena thermophila. We hypothesized that a silymarin-induced decrease in T. thermophila cholesterol levels would result in the downregulation of genes involved in sterol metabolism, specifically DES5 and DES7. The DES5 and DES7 genes encode for C-5(6) sterol desaturase and C-7(8) sterol desaturase, respectively, and their encoded enzymes catalyze the conversion of most sterol species in T. thermophila. To test our hypothesis, T. thermophila cells were treated with either control media or silymarin supplemented media for 48 hours. Following treatment, behavioral assays were performed to determine the effect of silymarin on membrane fluidity, cell signaling, and cilia composition. Furthermore, Reverse Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to measure expression of the DES5 and DES7 genes. The silymarin treatment was predicted to lower DES5 and DES7 expression due to decreased availability of cholesterol and subsequent sterol species. Also, we predicted lower cell motility due to reduced membrane fluidity, impaired cell signaling, and slower cilia growth compared to control groups."
"Olivia Smith, Sarah Early, Gunner Gleasman",Special Education,Equity in Gifted Education: Overcoming Underrepresentation,"Underrepresentation in gifted education impacts the long-term academic results of students from historically marginalized groups. The identification of high-ability learners is significantly affected by systemic biases against ethnicity, race, and socioeconomic status. Factors such as deficit thinking, colorblind ideology, and white privilege contribute to the perpetuation of this disproportionate representation. Disproportionality is exacerbated by limiting access to advanced experiences, maintaining inequality, and reinforcing systemic disadvantages. By hindering access to learning opportunities, gifted marginalized students face significant challenges in achieving post-secondary success and a lack of vocational, social, and economic pathways. There have been efforts to address these issues, such as redefining giftedness, using universal screening measures, and implementing culturally responsive teaching practices in the classroom. Researchers also stress the importance of early intervention and policy reforms to ensure equal access to gifted education services. Using local norms for identification, which compares student academic performance to their same-grade peers at their school instead of national standards, could lead to a more diverse population of gifted students. To effectively tackle the lasting problem of underrepresentation in gifted education, a shift in educational practices and societal perceptions of diversity in education is necessary. This project will examine, “To what extent does underrepresentation in gifted education impact the long-term academic outcomes of students from historically marginalized groups?”"
"Norbert Karczewski, Abrianna Burrows",Environmental Science,Cemeteries and the Soil Record,"This study investigates the potential of utilizing cemeteries as a relatively undisturbed record of historical and geographic urban lead levels. Helena and East Helena have, at different times, been known for larger scale production and distribution of lead, among other industrial products. Possible lead sources range from the old smelter, the transportation of lead via railway, to driving cars with gasoline containing lead. We hypothesize that the impact and distribution of these historical lead sources may be preserved within Helena’s cemeteries. We aim to address the question: “Can cemeteries be used as a tool to assess historical lead levels?” Our study employs a systematic approach by selecting cemeteries located along temporal and spatial gradients in and round the city of Helena. In each cemetery, we will identify peripheral areas suitable for the study. Where possible, soils will be collected along transects roughly perpendicular to suspected sources, with location recorded by GPS. Soils will be analyzed using a Niton XL2 Plus Handheld XRF Analyzer to determine the presence and amount of lead and other contaminants. Results of this analysis will be presented as a map indicating notable variations in soil lead level, if present, within the cemetery. This research not only sheds light on past lead exposure but also underscores the potential of cemeteries as valuable repositories of historical environmental data. Such insights hold significance for informing future urban planning strategies and public health interventions aimed at mitigating lead exposure risks."
"Audrey Parkey, Liam Lynch",Biology,Elucidating Osteoarthritis Endotypes in Human Synovial Fluid via Global Metabolomic Profiling,"Osteoarthritis (OA) poses a challenge to human health by causing progressive joint degradation and associated symptoms. The complex interplay of risk factors such as joint trauma, abnormal joint loading, obesity and advanced age underscore the need to better define OA phenotypes for targeted treatment options. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize metabolic phenotypes of OA. Synovial fluid (SF) samples from the Carroll College IRB-approved biobank were utilized in this study. Ten healthy post-mortem samples were designated as controls, and 12 SF samples from living patients diagnosed with OA were analyzed as the experimental group. Metabolites were extracted from the fluid, and analyzed at Montana State University using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Unsupervised statistical methods were used to identify subgroups of OA patients as possible metabolic phenotypes. Supervised statistical methods were employed to identify key metabolites differentiating between subgroups which were then mapped to metabolic pathways. Our findings reveal distinct groupings of OA patients, identified as Group 1 (G1) and Group 2 (G2). Group 1 exhibited increased joint effusion and decreased metabolism of amino acids like lysine in the SF. Conversely, G2 was characterized by reduced joint effusion and decrease of both amino acid and fatty acid metabolism. The results suggest that treatment based on lysine and fatty acid metabolism profiles could serve as a basis for optimal clinical intervention tailored to individual OA metabolic phenotypes."
"Noel Teders, Audrey Narum, Jacque Malheiros",Nursing,Various Healthcare Responses to the Opioid Crisis,"Today, the United States faces one of the deadliest epidemics: the opioid crisis. Citizens of the United States have access to opioids through various means including inappropriate prescribing and through illegal use. With these controlled substances at peoples’ fingertips, there is extreme susceptibility to overdose. With the high likelihood of overdose amongst users who abuse, preparedness to reverse an overdose can mean the difference between life and death. While both EMS services and hospital services are trained to treat overdoses, more research is needed to determine how different practices and environments affect end results. This review will use research articles studying the effectiveness of both EMS and hospital responses to determine current patient outcomes. By examining the effectiveness of EMS and hospital responses to overdose, this review can help the healthcare system identify areas where further education is needed. Furthermore, the goal of this review is to inform policymakers of discrepancies in knowledge, improve treatment and response protocols, and improve overall short and long-term outcomes of the opioid overdose patient."
Maggie Young,Anthrozoology,The Power of Paws: A Literature Review of Therapy Dogs in the Hospital Setting,"Since 1980, animal-assisted interventions, defined as the valuable utilization of specially trained animals in services to improve human health, have gained popularity in the hospital setting. This literature review examines the role of therapy dogs in hospitals, specifically focusing on their impact on patients' pain, anxiety, depression, and cardiopulmonary pressures. The results of randomized data and survey data suggest that patients and their families who interacted with therapy dogs experienced significant reductions in these symptoms, as well as, increased motivation to participate in group sessions and fewer emotional behaviors and outbursts compared to those without therapy dog visitations. Additionally, a high percentage of patients in the Emergency Department expressed a desire for therapy dogs to be present during their treatments. These findings highlight the benefits of animal-assisted interventions in hospitals and support the need for further research in this area.

Julian Betz,Health Science,Effects of Probiotic Treatment for Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder,"Objective: To review relevant literature regarding probiotic treatment for individuals with Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) as an alternative to treatment with stimulant medication.Methods: This literature was gathered through PubMed and CINAHL in the Fall of 2023 and assessed for the effects of probiotic treatments in comparison to more commonly prescribed stimulant medications. Interventions included various probiotics including Synbiotic 2000, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Saffron, and others.Results: Probiotic intervention as a form of treatment for ADHD showed significant evidence improving sleep, decreasing side effects of the disease, as well as improving overall quality of life.Discussion: The use of probiotics when treating ADHD had significantly positive outcomes when used as an alternative to pharmacotherapy. These results included improved sleep, increased cognitive functioning, and decreased attention hyperactivity The findings of this review can be used to guide patients with ADHD or their caretakers when considering probiotic treatments for their disorder to avoid the common adverse effects of medication treatments which include lack of sleep and decreased appetite. Some beneficial outcomes resulting from probiotic treatment of ADHD includes increased gut microbiome which results in improving sleep quality, cognitive functioning, and overall quality of life for individuals suffering from this disorder."
"Elliot Wald, Macie Holmes",Neuroscience,Smell That? The effects of Aromatherapy on Drosophila melanogaster Behavior,"Homeopathic remedies are hailed as non-pharmacological, cheap alternatives to more expensive pharmaceutical treatments. Essential oils are an example of a homeopathic therapy that people use to improve their moods or boost their energy. Currently, there is a lack of research surrounding the quantitative effects of essential oils on mood and energy, as most reports about their functionality are qualitative. In this study, different aromatherapy treatments were tested on the model organism Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies) to see how they impacted fly behaviors related to energy and mood. The oils tested were pure lavender, which claims to have a calming effect, and lemon, which claims to have an energizing effect. To generate doses that were physiologically relevant for the fruit flies, these extracts were diluted in a carrier jojoba oil. To observe the effects of these essential oils on fly behavior, three assays were performed to measure energy levels, feeding behavior, and grooming behavior. It was expected that the lemon aromatherapy would increase energy, feeding, and grooming behaviors in the flies while the lavender aromatherapy would result in opposing effects. Our findings suggest that both the lemon and lavender treatments caused a significant increase in energy and feeding behavior when compared to control groups."
Allison Bullman,Anthrozoology,How Pigs Can Help Deer: Analysis of Urban Deer Management Techniques Concerning Contraception as a Potential Effective Method of Control,"Given the increasing number of deer finding their way into urban cities, many conflicts have arisen that have caused human economic loss and an increase in concern about safety. From this, there has been a push to find methods to manage these urban deer populations, especially as they overpopulate. Upon further analysis of different sources of literature, five groups of management methods are used across the United States: (1) public management, (2) sharpshooting and managed hunts, (3) culling, (4) live capture and release, and (5) contraception; all with many different viewpoints associated with public perception, effectiveness and consistency, financial concern, and ethical analysis. These management methods will be discussed concerning the conflicts deer have caused in urban cities, specifically focusing on the urban deer population management plan of Helena, MT. Lastly, further discussion of contraception, looking specifically at experimental contraceptive Porcine Zona Pellucida (PZP), as a method to managing urban deer populations creates a push towards further analysis of research on the topic to better give evidence to this potentially effective and humane method of urban deer population management that can check off all of the boxes of concern."
Lily Hoelscher,Gender Studies,The Transmutation of Woman: An Examination of Female Otherness and Gender Performance,"Woman has been maligned, erased, and constructed as the “lesser sex” since the early ages of human civilization. Only in more recent years has there been any success in overturning this narrative, and the steps that have been made still leave much to be desired. Equality appears a long distance away yet, even if studies show that the male and female brain really are no different from one another, and even chromosomal sex designations exist on a varied spectrum and not a simple binary. Human beings are more alike than they are different, and as put forth by Judith Butler in Gender Trouble, gendered social presentation is simply how a person acts in public based upon how they identify, or have been told they should identify. The seventeenth-century Spanish play Valor, agravio y mujer treats the subject of gendered presentation in its overturning of roles as Leonor, the heroine, dresses as a man and in essence becomes man to exact revenge upon Don Juan, who stole her honor and abandoned her. For all intents and purposes, Leonor becomes more man than woman in her conduct and social role, effectively distancing herself from that feminine state of the “other” which has been examined in many feminist works for decades. Using the example of this piece of literature, the lenses of such authors as Butler, Simone de Beauvoir, Luce Irigaray, and others will illuminate the blurred lines of gender and the systems that so starkly isolate woman in her “otherness”."
Clare Daley,Hispanic Studies,"Master and Servant, Servant and Master: Social-Class Colonialism and its Effect in the Duties of the “Sidekick” in the Spanish Golden Age Theatre","In Don Quijote de la Mancha, by Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra, Don Quixote and Sancho Panza tackle imaginary evils. However, both characters represent real struggles through their dynamic of servant and master. As in Don Quijote, other hispanic art—especially theatre from El Siglo de Oro español (“the Spanish Golden Age”)— explores this connection between social classes. El burlador de Sevilla y convidado de piedra, by Tirso de Molina, is where the infamous Don Juan first appears along with Catalinón, who’s warnings are not heeded; Valor, agravio, y muger, by Ana Caro de Mallén, has disguised Leonor seeking justice with trusty Ribete; and lastly La vida es sueño, by Pedro Calderon de la Barca, involves King Basillo locking his son away and when the people seek their heir, servant Clarín is mixed up in it all. In his The Politics of Aesthetics, Jacques Rancière states “[a]rtistic practices are ‘ways of doing and making’ that intervene in the general distribution of ways of doing and making as well as in the relationships they maintain to modes of being and forms of visibility.” Taking this idea into consideration, what do the sidekicks’ modes of being and forms of visibility symbolize in Hispanic theatre, and how do class stereotypes reveal the social dynamics between a servant and a master? I argue that the role of the “sidekick” is an analogy for people who are underestimated due to their social class, and who are the subjects of a regime of  “social-class colonialism”, which is the oppression from outside forces such as colonizers with the particular bias against monetary privilege and favors the upper classes."
Kiki Bourekis,Biology,Identifying Metabolic Differences in Males and Females Affected by Osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disease in the body, characterized by limited mobility due to the degradation of cartilage. Age, weight, and genetic profiles have been identified as clear risk factors for OA; women are more likely to suffer from OA compared to men. While previous research indicates that postmenopausal women have an increased likelihood of developing OA due to decreasing estrogen, few studies have investigated metabolic differences between diseased males and females. This study seeks to understand the differences between the global metabolic profiles of males and females with OA. In order to investigate metabolic discrepancies, metabolites were extracted from joint-effusion-related OA synovial fluid. Global metabolomic profiling by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) was then employed to identify significant metabolic differences between sexes. The results of this study suggested a distinct metabolic response to OA in males and females, most notably a significant difference between fatty acid and amino acid metabolism. This study provided a greater understanding of metabolism in OA pathogenesis and suggested opportunities for more individualized, therapeutic interventions that target sex differences. In the future, researchers should replicate this experiment with a larger sample size and employ targeted metabolomics to further elucidate the role of fatty acid metabolism in OA responses."
Maile Allzer,Nursing,The Impact of Mindfulness on Stress in Healthcare Professionals,"The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) reports that within the next 5 years, 25% of practicing nurses are going to switch careers or retire. Close to 2/3 of the nurses practicing today experience burnout for a variety of different reasons, the biggest being perceived stress. Perceived stress is defined as the subjectivity of stress and how a person experiences it. The subjectivity of perceived stress can be beneficial because it provides an opportunity to impact someone’s thinking through non-invasive and easily implementable measures. A decrease in perceived stress can then translate to decreased burnout. One of the ways suggested to fight this stress and burnout in the nursing profession is through mindfulness. Mindfulness teaches that one can respond in a positive way, even to stressful situations, through self regulation and interpersonal skills. This comes from Buddhist teachings and was defined as “paying purposeful and conscious attention to the present, without judging current concepts” (Chen et. al., 2021, para 3). Researchers have found that a nurse successfully implementing mindfulness in their daily life can better manage their mood, states, well-being, attention, and consciousness. The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to evaluate the effects that mindfulness interventions have on healthcare professionals’ stress across the world."
Anna Russell,Gender Studies,Exploring the Realities of Sex and Sexuality in Women’s Prisons,"The sexual lives of female inmates are impacted by strip searches, imbalanced power dynamics, violence, and isolation. This study uses existing literature as the methodological foundation. Erving Goffman's theories of contamination in total institutions and Luce Irigaray’s theories on sexuality provide the theoretical framework to make sense of women’s experiences of sex and sexuality within the prison system. The research in this study focuses on four main factors; strip searches, imbalanced power dynamics, sexual violence, and isolation from the outside world. By focusing on strip searches, power dynamics, and sexual violence, this study aims to show how women experience forced sex or expressions of sexuality in the prison system. Alternatively, the factor of isolation aims to show how women experience restricted sexual expression while having limited interaction with the outside world."
Thomas Louie,Communications,Straw Dogs: Sam Peckinpah’s Cultural Meditation on Violence and Masculinity,"The removal of the Hollywood Film Production Code in 1968 spawned a new era of filmmakers that challenged many American social norms. Among these filmmakers was Sam Peckinpah, who’s revolutionary film Straw Dogs explored masculinity, clashing cultures, and gender dynamics in all its dark, violent nature. Following a mild-mannered mathematician who slowly falls into a cycle of violence, Straw Dogs captures the long held notion that to be a man requires violent rites of passage, and that love, family, and home are sacrificed in these brutal tests of manhood. Still a very controversial film to this day for its portrayal of violence, misogyny, and depravity, Straw Dogs provides a unique case study for aggression theory, and whether these masculine behaviors are intrinsic or learned. In a film that holds a mirror up to society, condemning it as crude, violent, and uncivilized, Sam Peckinpah displays the harsh nature of masculinity and violence, but leaves it up to the viewer as to how it needs to be addressed."
Ariana Collins,Philosophy,The Meaning of Suffering,"In  this paper I analyze the nature of suffering. Evidently wars occur, people suffer in famine, poverty, starvation, homelessness, and in the challenges of everyday life. This provoked the question, what is suffering? In what ways can a person suffer? Is there meaning in this suffering? Coming to understand suffering and the pathway to overcoming suffering can very well change our outlook when we do inevitably come to suffer. Not only this, it may change the manner in which we suffer. When we turn inwards thus becoming bitter, miserable, and vengeful it affects our ability to live the good life. In encountering the philosophy of Freidrich Nietzsche, I was enticed to look further into the effects of suffering. Especially because he views suffering as fundamental to the human condition. I engage Arthur Schopenhauer as an opposer to my thesis citing his pessimistic philosophy of suffering. Then using particular cases regarding extreme suffering such as Holocaust survivors Jean Amery and Viktor Frankl. Showing how meaning can be born of suffering. Thus, arguing that meaning is born from the suffering endured in life which aids the human person in the pursuit of the good life."
"Miranda Bruhn, Rebecca Rich, Stephanie Hodges",Nursing,Telehealth is a sustainable adjunct to in-person routine medical visits,"In this current age, is telehealth a lasting solution to increasing accessibility when used in replacement of office visits? During COVID-19, telehealth became well known due to its increased utilization to prevent contraction of the virus. This introduced the need to have a virtual option for patients to access health care for various reasons. These reasons include, but are not limited to: immunocompromised, socioeconomic status, elderly, disabled, limited or no transportation, rural areas, and busy work lives. Telehealth is an alternative to in-person visits because it allows patients to have an increased amount of positive health outcomes and lowered overall cost. Telehealth, also called telemedicine, is the use of virtual meetings to connect with health care staff. Whereas, in person office visits refer to appointments that take place in hospitals, clinics, or other health care locations. The purpose of this project is to highlight the indispensability of telehealth post COVID-19. Telehealth has multiple benefits that can be utilized, such as decreased cost, increased accessibility, and convenience, making it a viable option in partnership with the in-person visit."
Tristan Gallagher,Honors Scholar,The Struggle for Hope: Exploring the Human Condition Through Hobbes and Eliot,"What is most necessary to improve the human condition? What are the greatest dangers to human societies? Both 17th-century political philosopher Thomas Hobbes and 20th-century poet T.S. Eliot struggle to find hope for the human condition within their respective periods. Through the theory of Hobbes and the experience of Eliot, a greater understanding of human nature can be inferred. This comparison reveals two different kinds of hope. Eliot views human nature as something inherently good and believes in the ability for regrowth and positive progression. Hobbes is pessimistic about the human condition and therefore believes there is a limit to the progress of humankind. Neither Hobbes nor Eliot have a complete understanding of the complexity of human nature, nor do they have the answers as to why society isn’t better. But they do illuminate the aspects of human nature that both cause suffering and healing, allowing for a hopeful outlook on the future of humankind. By comparing Hobbes and Eliot, human nature can be explored and the human condition illuminated, as both struggle to find hope in the contemporary human condition."
"Hailey Camp, Makayla Bury, Cormac Benn",Elementary & Special Education,Quality vs. Quantity in Staffing,"Is maintaining a better qualified and fairly compensated staff more effective in providing special education services than increasing the number of staff members with potentially varied levels of expertise? As debates over funding have been predominant within education-related news over the past decade, we were curious about how limited funding is best spent. We hope that through this research, we’ll better grasp how resource allocation and equity of services can impact student outcomes. Our methods involve researching various recent primary sources regarding this topic while also conducting interviews with members of the Helena School District and possibly a mental health funds director for Child and Protective Service (CPS). We believe these sources will give us a better grasp on factors within special education that are often overlooked, therefore helping answer our research question. Our results will inform us and other educators on the most effective allocation of limited resources within special education. This could potentially lead to improved student outcomes through better-targeted investments in staff qualifications."
Delaney Boyle,International Relations,"Bridging the Divide: A Study on the Role of Gender Equality, Civil Society Groups, and Levels of Peace","A growing body of literature explores the relationship between gender equality and corresponding levels of peace within countries. Some scholars argue that female involvement in peace-making processes can significantly increase quality and durability. This may be because civil society groups act as ‘linkages’ between elites and the masses, which may help improve the terms of agreements or persuade a wider set of people to help sustain peace. More generally, scholars argue that civil society groups operate externally from government structures, garnering broad support for peace and providing a means for people with limited access to become involved in politics. I conducted a quantitative analysis of 32 African countries from 2019 to 2021 to test the relationship between levels of conflict and rates of female participation in civil society groups, particularly in countries where women have less formal power in parliaments. Additionally, I assessed development gaps between males and females to assess the broader relevance of gender equality. I found that female involvement in civil society groups was a strong indicator of peace, particularly where there was less official involvement in parliament. Greater gaps in development between males and females were linked to more intense conflict in the given period. These findings imply that fostering gender equality can have various positive implications for societies, particularly because it has the capability to decrease the severity and intensity of conflict."
"Kaden Gardner, Caleb Hoxie",Engineering,Residential Wind Turbine Design,"Utility Mapping Services (UMS, Clancy, MT) presented students in the Carroll College Senior Engineering Design Class with the opportunity to complete an engineering design for a Skystream 3.7 wind turbine. We are specifically tasked with choosing a preferred project location from seven alternatives. After a project location was selected, we are now preparing a foundation design for the wind turbine. UMS also tasked us with providing professional construction documents to give to a contractor to implement our design. When choosing a preferred project location we took into several factors. The Skystream 3.7 wind turbine has several design requirements that the selected project location needed to meet. This included undisturbed area, available height, and a minimum wind speed. Other considerations were how close the project site is to where the wind turbine is currently being stored in Jefferson City, Montana. Using the design requirements and location consideration, 8 Kestrel Drive Jefferson City, Montana was chosen as the project location. After picking a project location we have moved forward with designing an appropriate foundation and preparing the construction documents for UMS. The foundation design will be done to meet the design requirements for keeping the wind turbine erected for the design life. We believe that we have chosen a design location that meets the design requirements and is near the wind turbine’s current location. With this we have also produced a foundation design that is structurally sound for the duration of the wind turbine’s design life."
Natalie Bahou,History,The 1948 Palestinian Nakba: Origins and Effects on Refugees,"In 1948, when the state of Israel was created, thousands of Palestinians were forced to flee their homeland. Called the Nakba, which means catastrophe, this event changed around seven hundred thousand people’s lives. Some stayed in what would later become the Palestinian territories. Many fled to other countries - some neighboring Arab countries, others went to America. As the Arab-Israeli conflict deepened over the next seventy years, Palestinians would continue to be affected, for example with events in 1967. My paper examines what happened to the refugees of the 1948 Nakba. Where did they go? How were they affected by this tragic event? How did they rebuild their lives? Psychologically, how did that impact them for the rest of their lives? Where are their descendants now? Sources include recent academic and highly-researched books and articles, as well as older articles that shine a light on what the refugees have experienced. This research project provides future readers and my HI 241 audience a better understanding of the 1948 crisis in terms of what happened to the thousands of refugees whose lives were so totally upended. Their legacy continues - there are around six million descendants of theirs today whose lives were also impacted by what happened in 1948. Understanding the Nakba and its repercussions on ordinary Palestinians is crucial to understanding the roots of the current Palestinian-Israeli conflict, as well as understanding how humanity has to act and adapt in such tragic circumstances. As this topic sheds so much light on human nature, this context is crucial for forming a well-informed and nuanced point of view – and one that strives to find hope in every dark place."
John Paul Robertson,Honors Scholar,De Amicitia: Friendship in The Iliad and Consolation of Philosophy,"Through an examination of Homer’s Iliad and Boethius’ Consolation of Philosophy, this presentation works to show that humans are intentionally created to participate and share in friendship with God, which can be emulated and brought to fruition through human friendships. The demises of their characters, the Greek Priam and Roman Boethius, can be charted alongside one another, arriving at a shared destination of discerning the source of happiness. Highlighting the contrast in Lady Philosophy's emphasis on happiness deriving from relationship with the steadfast Divine in The Consolation of Philosophy to Aristotle’s argument of happiness being of a nature that can be disposed of by pathos, perspectives surrounding the downfalls of both characters present a point where the importance and impact of friendship must be addressed. Through the reciprocity found within the friendships between humanity and the Divine and humanity and other humans, an argument is formulated that our relationships with the Divine affect and sculpt our relationships with other humans."
Henry Phillip,Nursing,Mobile Health Clinics and Diseases Surveillance,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “About 46 million Americans—15% of the US population--live in rural areas.” Compared to urban populations, rural areas have a higher prevalence of heart disease, cancer, and chronic lower respiratory disease. The rates of chronic conditions in rural areas are higher because the barriers of transportation availability, expense, limited education, and absence from work or family all must be overcome for healthcare to be received. Mobile health clinics (MHC) are traveling healthcare facilities and may be a solution to the many barriers that prevent rural Americans from receiving healthcare. MHC performs disease prevalence surveillance, medical condition prevention or management education, and disease treatment. There are currently over 414 MHC in the United States, each demonstrating the viability of MHC as a potential tool to improve rural healthcare. The purpose of this evidenced-based practice literature review is to determine whether MHC in rural areas would be effective in increasing the accuracy of disease surveillance rates. Three articles were reviewed and the findings serve as evidence for nurses focused on creating a MHC network in Montana that increases healthcare access and the efficacy of community health practices. MHC provides the opportunity for student nurses to gain experience evaluating patients and expand the impact of the MHC for the staff."
"Ben Mehlhaff, Cam Pruitt",Engineering,"Airport Beacon Replacement in Stanford, MT","Robert Peccia & Associates presented the Carroll College Engineering Design Class an opportunity to perform the engineering design for a replacement airport beacon for Judith Basin County Airport. The project is in Stanford, Montana. We have been asked to provide engineering for replacement of the current beacon, which is supported by a traditional lattice structure with a Tip-down style beacon. The current beacon has exceeded its design life and is no longer serviceable. Our current design calls for either removing the current beacon and placing the new one in the same location or finding a new location near the airport. Currently, the State Historical Preservation Office is evaluating the historical significance of the existing beacon and, therefore, removal of the current structure may not be possible. We are proceeding with our design with the assumption that SHPO will ultimately allow removal and replacement which will allow us to complete our design within the timeline of our senior design course. We selected a tip-down beacon for its lower cost, and lower maintenance difficulty due to the airport manager being a volunteer who lives locally. The smaller profile of the Tip-Down beacon discourages birds from landing and creating nests on the beacon, the reduced waste from birds will reduce maintenance as well. Other than birds there is not much else for environmental factors within this project. It will take only 1-2 weeks of construction for this process to be completed so that part will not take long. We will have the beacon sit on a 10 foot by 10 foot concrete slab on the edge of airport property. While using our cost estimation for the project, we will contact potential subcontractors that have done projects like this before, evaluating those who will do the job for the best price as well as their capability of providing a quality product."
Mariah Moran,Anthrozoology,Zoonotic Risks Involved with Animal-Assisted Care,"Animals have been proven to help human health in various ways, especially when it comes to animal assisted activities. In the last decade animal assisted care opportunities have increased as well as become more defined in the field. With this increased contact between animals and often immune-compromised individuals, more research has been conducted about the potential threat of zoonotic diseases. Comparing the results of multiple studies allows oversight of animal assisted activities including service animals, animal assisted interventions, and the partnership with exotic animals in these roles. With animals being welcomed into human health care the animals first should be held to a health standard for the safety of everyone involved."

"Kennedy Venner, Isabel Koivu, Hannah Sempf, Connor Sullivan",Elementary & Special Education,Promoting Student Involvement and Self-Determination in Transition Planning for High School Students,"Student involvement in transition planning is essential to increase self-determination and future success. The emphasis on student-led planning, parental influences, and the effects of transition services for students with disabilities enhances this transition. Our research addresses the gap in transition planning that high school students face. We seek to identify optimal strategies to enhance students' self-determination and post-graduation success. We have found the ideal strategies for support by drawing from a variety of perspectives, exploring the goals of students with disabilities during transition planning, and finding the best plan of action for these students. According to research, adolescents with disabilities who participate in transition planning have a higher chance of succeeding as adults. Students with disabilities who do not participate in their transition planning often experience barriers to achieving positive post-school outcomes. To achieve successful post-school outcomes, students and their families can overcome obstacles through effective transition planning. Providing students with opportunities to strengthen their self-determination is essential during the transition planning process. These opportunities focus on critical skills related to college and career readiness, such as problem-solving, ownership of learning, and academic engagement. As future educators, we are responsible for promoting student involvement and self-determination in transition planning. By providing the tools necessary for this process to be successful, we can ensure that those with learning disabilities can have the opportunity to be contributing members of society."
"Emma Pinal, Vicente Ortega",Biology,Influence of Ginkgo biloba on survival and cell cycle regulation in Tetrahymena thermophila under acute stressful conditions,"Ginkgo biloba has been widely used for therapeutic purposes for centuries, especially in Chinese medicine. The supplement, which is extracted from the leaves of the Ginkgo tree, has been used to treat a variety of different ailments, including Dementia, Allergies, and Peripheral Artery Disease; however, the results of its effectiveness as a treatment are inconclusive. In order to test the effectiveness of Ginkgo biloba, we investigated the survival and cell cycle regulation of Tetrahymena thermophila that were subjected to a heat shock stressor. We hypothesized that T. thermophila exposed to acute heat shock would benefit from Ginkgo biloba treatment, as it would promote expression of the genes CDK3 and CDC7, both of which are involved in cell cycle regulation, while improving cell proliferation, metabolic activity, and feeding when compared to untreated cells. To test our hypothesis, T. thermophila cultures that were either treated or untreated with Gingko biloba were placed in an acute heat shock environment of 35 °C for 20 minutes.  Following the heat shock treatment, T. thermophila cultures were maintained for 48 hours before undergoing behavioral assays to measure cell growth, metabolism, and feeding, along with Real Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) to measure expression of CDK3 and CDC7. Given the previously reported protective effects of Ginkgo biloba, we predicted an increase in CDK3 and CDC7 expression in the stressed T. thermophila cultures that were treated with Ginkgo biloba along with an increase in behaviors related to cell growth and metabolism."
Amber Rauser,Nursing,The Effect of Low Nurse Staffing on Patient Outcomes,"In recent years, the topic of adequate nurse staffing has been widely discussed. The American Healthcare Association (AHCA) reported in 2023, that an estimated 100,000 registered nurses (RNs) left their profession as a result of stress/burnout experienced during the pandemic. Furthermore, the report projected a shortage of 200,000 to 450,000 RNs by 2025. The nurses who stay are facing an increased number of patients to care for during a shift. An increased number of patients has multiple negative adverse effects, which include increasing the risk of hospital acquired infections such as pneumonia and sepsis, and in some cases, death. Researchers have concluded the prevalence of a small patient load being incremental in positive patient outcomes, yet hospitals nationwide continue to set the nurse-patient ratios high. In a study of 232,342 surgical patients, from a group of Pennsylvania hospitals, 4,535 died one month after their discharge. The results revealed out of the total number discharged, the difference was estimated to 1,000 deaths when comparing patient-nurse ratios of either 4:1 or 8:1. The need to increase nurse-to-patient ratios is imperative for positive patient outcomes and to reduce the incidence of hospital acquired infections, failure to rescue rates, falls, pressure injuries and death. Appropriate nurse staffing is necessary to maintain safety and quality outcomes. The purpose of this EBP review is to compare low nurse staffing to adequate nurse staffing and the effects of each on patient outcomes."
"Garrett Oleson, Natalie Brown",Environmental Science,"Reconstructing Glaciers in The Anaconda and Flint Ranges, SW Montana","This project aims to reconstruct former glaciers and small ice caps in the Anaconda and Flint Creek Ranges in Southwest Montana, and to use those reconstructions to estimate paleoclimate conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) 20,000 yrs ago. While ice sheets encroached from Canada and significant ice caps formed on the Yellowstone Plateau and northern Rocky Mountains, the mountain ranges of western Montana were primarily occupied by valley glaciers and small ice caps. The lowering of regional snowlines during the LGM can be interpreted from reconstructing the extent, elevation, and equilibrium line altitude (ELA) of former glaciers. This project asks the question: can reconstructing maximum glacial extent and associated ELA depression help inform paleoclimate interpretations on a more local scale in SW Montana? Satellite imagery and topographic data were used to map terminal and lateral moraines, erosional trimlines, and to reconstruct glacier surface area and ice thickness. A physical ice flow model (modified for use in  Excel) was used to reconstruct glacial surface profiles. The ELAs of reconstructed LGM glaciers were estimated using accumulation/ablation area ratio and maximum lateral moraine elevation. Preliminary findings suggest a greater lowering of ELA on the east side of these ranges relative to west, and may suggest a more local source of moisture during the LGM. By providing data on glacial extent and snowline on smaller valley glaciers, this work will help fill gaps in regional paleoclimate reconstructions and may provide valuable insight on more localized influences of climate on glacial systems."
"Juliette Crichton, Adisyn O'Connor, Ezekiel Bradbury, Kelly White, Rachel Kaiser",Biochemistry,Synthesizing a Viable Indicator for Staphylococcus Aureus,"The objective of this research project is to synthesize a viable indicator for Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) to aid medical professionals in rapid and efficient testing for the bacterial infection it causes in humans. The V-8 protease produced by the bacteria cleaves polypeptide bonds specific to glutamic acid. Therefore, a proposed substrate-dye complex has been established utilizing glutamic acid bound to glycine which is then attached to a dye, 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). When the indicator is intact, glutamic acid quenches DCF and prevents it from fluorescing but when the protease cleaves the peptide bond, the dye glows therefore confirming the presence of S. aureus. The goal of this semester’s work is to bind the components of the dye-amino acid complex together to synthesize the indicator. The process of Fischer esterification will be employed to add protecting groups to the glutamic acid of the dipeptide bond. If the esterification is successful, DCF will then be attached to the dipeptide utilizing aromatic substitution and the indicator can be tested in a culture of S. aureus."

Noah Lohar,Chemistry,Application of Thiophene Electrochemistry for Solar Fuels,"Viable and efficient alternative solar fuels have implications from the renewable energy industry to space exploration. The long-range goal of this research is to use visible light to form carbon-carbon bonds via oxidative homocoupling reaction. Thiophene compounds with an alpha-proton were used to investigate the viability of using visible light to drive carbon-carbon bond formation. The synthesis, purification, and characterization of 2-(4-nitrophenyl) thiophene and 5,5'-bis(4-nitrophenyl)-2,2'-bithiophene was achieved. Cyclic Voltammogram (CV) and computational data fitting were used to estimate the kinetic parameters for the electrochemical oxidative homocoupling of thiophene compounds. A lambda max of 345 nm was observed for 2-(4-nitrophenyl) thiophene using UV-vis spectroscopy. Spectroelectrochemical measurements for the oxidation of 2-(4-nitrophenyl) thiophene show a decrease in the absorption at 375 nm and an increase in the absorption band red of 500 nm consistent with an oxidative homocoupling reaction to form 5,5'-bis(4-nitrophenyl)-2,2'-bithiophene."
Anna Brown,English,"Word Relationships: “Amateur,” “Enemy,” “Amorous,” and “Amiable”","Where do words come from? For this project, I look specifically at the words “Amateur,” “Enemy,” “Amorous,” and “Amiable,” to examine their common origin and how they have developed into the words we see today. Most words have origins going back to the Proto-Indo-European language, which is a prehistoric language that was not written down but has been reconstructed. Linguists examine the similarities in different languages to arrive at what must have been the root word. The following project incorporates different languages and their pronunciations and usages of these words as they developed from the Proto-Indo-European word “em.” By looking at word development,  I examine the different ways words can be formed, such as prefix, suffix, metathesis, and semantic shift (or changes in word definitions). Studying word origins is important because it gives insight into how other cultures have influenced our own and what our language has borrowed and pieced together to make the words we speak today."
Stephanie Westlund,Nursing,The Effect of Kangaroo Care on Premature Infant Feeding,"Following premature birth, many infants need to stay in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to receive supportive care due to being underweight and lacking full development that would have been achieved while in utero until full term. Approximately 10% to 15% of babies born in the U.S. every year are admitted to the NICU. The practice of kangaroo care in the NICU can provide many health benefits for neonates. Kangaroo care, also known as skin-to-skin, is the technique of holding a baby, wearing only a diaper, on the bare chest of a parent or care giver. The benefits of kangaroo care include temperature regulation, improved breathing, circulation, sleep and growth, and improve parent baby bonding. The purpose of this Evidence Based research is to assess the effect of kangaroo care on the success of feeding in premature infants in the NICU setting. Nurses can use the outcome of this research to improve feeding in premature infants in the NICU. Improve feeding leads to increased weight gain, shorter time to discharge, shorter transition to entirely enteral feeding, stabilization of vital signs, decreased gastric residual volume, less incidence of vomiting and diarrhea, and overall decreased feeding intolerance."

"Mila Duncan, Hannah Kolb",Biochemistry,"Examining the Effects of the homeopathic supplement, Nux Vomica, on metabolism in Tetrahymena thermophila","The seeds of the Strychnos Nux-Vomica tree have been used in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries and have carried over to modern homeopathic medicine due to claims that it is a cure-all supplement for everything from liver cancer to hangover relief. Nux vomica's supposed medical benefits are thought to arise from the alkaloids, strychnine, and brucine found within the plant; however, there is little scientific evidence to support these claims. The goal of this research was to determine whether the Nux Vomica supplement would affect metabolism in the model organism, Tetrahymena thermophila. We hypothesized that Nux Vomica would alter expression of the CDK3 and CAM1 genes due to its proposed anti-tumor properties while also affecting cell replication, metabolic rate, and responsiveness to chemical stimulation. The CDK3 gene encodes a protein involved in cell cycle regulation while the CAM1 gene encodes a regulator of cytokinesis that is expressed during cell division. To test our hypothesis, T. thermophila was treated with Nux Vomica for 48 hours before expression of the CAM1 and CDK 3 genes was measured via Real-Time quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR).  The T. thermophila cultures were also subjected to 3 behavioral assays at the end of the treatment period, including cell counting to monitor growth, deciliation to determine metabolic rate, and chemotaxis to analyze chemical responsiveness.  We predicted that exposure to Nux Vomica would result in increased expression of the CDK3 and CAM1 genes, increased metabolic rate and chemical responsiveness, and decreased cell growth."
Erik Muskett,Nursing,De-escalation Training and the Reduction of Physical Restraints,"Physical Restraints (PR) are manual methods that restrict the freedom of movement of patients that are a danger to themselves or others. Although PR are sometimes necessary, they are associated with negative physical and psychological outcomes for patients and the nurses who must apply them. PR can cause pressure injuries, pain, joint dislocation, and more serious problems including pulmonary embolism, asphyxiation, and death. PR can also cause decline in cognitive ability, post-traumatic stress disorder, humiliation, and shame. Further, nurses can be physically assaulted during PR, which increases burnout, sick leave, and impacts their psychological well-being and ability to form therapeutic relationships with patients. The need for proper training that decreases violence and aggression is essential for nurses as 25% report being assaulted by patients. "
"Madelyn Franz, Belle Anselmo",Biology,Exploring the relationship between osteoarthritis and age with global metabolomic profiling,"Age is one of the most prevalent risk factors for osteoarthritis (OA). Prior research has revealed changes in joint tissues within the aging body, including cartilage thinning, a decrease in synovial fluid, increased risk for osteoporosis, and a decrease in bone volume. Factors such as chondrocyte senescence and oxidative stress also change with age and may contribute to OA pathogenesis. Global metabolomic profiling was used to identify metabolic variations in human OA synovial fluid samples below and above the age of 70 to better understand the relationship between age and OA. It was hypothesized that older patients identified with OA would show metabolic profiles that were more distinctly upregulated or downregulated within OA-altered metabolic pathways. Metabolites were extracted from synovial fluid, and identified using LC-MS. The processed data was uploaded into MetaboAnalyst for univariate (fold change) and multivariate (OPLS-DA) statistical analyses. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed on extracted metabolite features from fold change and OPLS-DA to compare age cohorts, as well as all OA samples with healthy samples separately. Across analyses, lysine metabolism was significantly distinct and upregulated within OA patients over 70, and OPLS-DA pathway analysis revealed linoleate metabolism was different between age cohorts. Glutathione, vitamin E, and purine metabolism were also all distinct between age groups. These findings present more specified potential areas for further research to understand how aging processes relate to OA pathogenesis. Clearer understandings of this connection could translate to more tailored treatments based upon age, and more effective preventative measures for OA."
Erin Welter,Gender Studies,An Analysis on Gender Disparity in Healthcare Systems,"This research will delve into the reasoning behind the top gendered healthcare disparities. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), gendered based health inequalities disproportionately affect women and girls due to having a lower status and less control in making decisions regarding their bodies, relationships, families and communities which introduces them to violence, coercion, and harmful practices (Gender and Health, n.d.). The focus of this research will be on the ways in which targets on gender in healthcare are apparent in our society, including high risk factors of sexually transmitted infections, cervical cancer, depression, malnutrition, and others that are apparent in female individuals and other people. I will also incorporate gender theorists and their writings to address these issues. Gender inequality restricts women and girls to healthcare information and services such as mobility restrictions, limitation on decision-making autonomy, constraint to finance access, lowered literacy rates, and discrimination from healthcare providers (Gender and Health, n.d.). The purpose of this study is to address these and more gender-based disparities in healthcare and suggest options to lessen these inequalities."
Thomas McGree,Health Science,Physical Therapy to Treat Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo,"Objective: To review literature regarding canalith repositioning maneuvers (CRP) and their effectiveness in treating patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar were used to identify articles included in this systematic review. These studies looked at physical therapy, specifically CRP, and their effects on BPPV.Results: All articles used in this review found that CRP had positive effects in short term resolution of symptoms regarding BPPV. Sufficient evidence was not available to determine whether or not CRP resulted in long-term resolution of BPPV symptoms.Discussion: CRP is an effective treatment method of BPPV with a less likelihood of recurrence compared to not performing these maneuvers. Treating patients during the acute onset of BPPV symptoms showed better results than delaying the rehabilitation process. Physical and other therapists treating BPPV should be encouraged to incorporate CRP into their treatment modalities.

"Elizabeth Kirby, Elissa Mazkour",Biology,The Impacts of Coenzyme Q10 Supplementation on Metabolism in Tetrahymena thermophila,"Coenzyme Q is an integral component of the electron transport chain and functions by transporting electrons from Complexes I and II to Complex III within the inner mitochondrial membrane. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is the most common form of Coenzyme Q found in humans and is a popular homeopathic supplement that claims to improve symptoms of degenerative diseases by increasing the efficiency of mitochondrial ATP production. In order to determine whether  CoQ10 increases mitochondrial efficiency in Tetrahymena thermophila, we examined changes in metabolic rate and the expression of genes associated with ATP production. To accomplish this, three independent behavioral assays were performed weekly to assess proliferation rate, energy consumption, and cilia regeneration, all of which are indicators of metabolic rate. Additionally, Reverse Transcription quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed weekly to determine the expression of AAC1 and TTHERM_00532800. The AAC1 gene encodes the ADP/ATP transmembrane transporter protein while TTHERM_00532800 encodes the Cytochrome c domain protein of the electron transport chain. As a result of CoQ10 exposure, we predicted that expression of AAC1 and TTHERM_00532800 would be upregulated in T. thermophila due to enhanced mitochondrial efficiency in ATP production. Consequently, we predicted that the CoQ10-exposed T. thermophila would demonstrate greater proliferation, increased energy consumption, and an accelerated metabolic rate."

Chlamydia trichomatis is the most common STI, with one in 20 sexually active women being infected. Long term Chlamydia infections can lead to infertility, and even vision loss in the case of eye exposure. We tested for association between socioeconomic status, environmental factors and Chlamydia incidence rates within the 56 counties in Montana. We used county wide, passively surveyed, aggregated data on incidence rates of Chlamydia for the past 10 years. Poverty and education levels were the two socioeconomic variables investigated. We also sought to elucidate the correlation between  various environmental factors that increase Chlamydia incidence. This data was analyzed for correlation by using a linear and multiple linear regression model. The less affluent counties have less access to adequate healthcare and education, which most likely correlates to higher STI incidence rates. The more moderate temperature climates most likely experience higher rates of Chlamydia based on previous research. Based on the colder temperatures at higher elevations, we believe there will be an inverse relationship between elevation and Chlamydia incidence rates. We will present our findings of which factors are significantly associated with Chlamydia incidence rates. Looking at both environmental and socioeconomic factors enables improved identification of at-risk areas and better-targeted preventive and screening efforts in order to decrease the prevalence of Chlamydia within Montana."
"Erica Nessan, Kaden Kastner, Wade Luly",Neuroscience,"Investigating the Effect of Homeopathic NMN on Cognition, Motor Function, and Mood of Drosophila malenogaster","Pure NMN, also known as ?-Nicotinamide Mononucleotide, is a fast-dissolving homeopathic supplement that claims to increase longevity and promote healthy aging. Although previous research found that NMN supplementation positively affects physical activity and cognitive function in humans, there are still significant gaps in our understanding of whether these supplements function as claimed. The goal of the current study was to investigate the effect of NMN supplementation on cognition, motor function, and mood in the model organism, Drosophila melanogaster (fruit flies). It was hypothesized that flies treated with the NMN supplement would exhibit increased motor function, enhanced cognition, and improved mood compared to control flies. To test our hypothesis, behavioral assays were performed on D. melanogaster that were treated with 1.2x10-7 g/mL of homeopathic NMN for one week. Following the treatment, a RING assay was performed to test motor function, a mating assay was performed to measure cognition, and a wall following assay was performed to measure changes in mood. The results of this study showed there was no significant difference in either cognition or mood-related behaviors in D. melanogaster that were treated with NMN; however, the NMN-treated flies did exhibit a significant improvement in motor function. Collectively, these results show that NMN supplementation may improve physical activity; however, further research needs to be performed regarding its claimed effects on cognition and mood."
Addison Ekstrom,Health Science,Blood Flow Restriction Training vs. Non-Occlusive Training in Patients After Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction: A Systematic Review ,"Objective: To review relevant literature comparing the effects of blood flow restriction training (BFRT) vs. non-occlusive training in patients following anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction surgery. Methods: Literature was gathered through PubMed and CINAHL and was reviewed for associations between BFR and patient outcomes after ACL reconstruction. Results: The use of BFRT showed favorable results compared to non-occlusive therapy in restoring knee function. BFR increased muscle hypertrophy, reduced knee joint pain and effusion while exhibiting tolerable use with no major side effects. Conclusions: The postoperative use of BFRT showed promising results for ACL reconstruction patients. The individualized prescription of BFRT should be studied further to be considered as a rehabilitation option for patients following ACL reconstruction."
Alison Ross,Environmental Science,Mapping Bathymetry and Modeling Historic Features in Lake Helena,"Lake Helena is located in the northeastern area of the Helena Valley and is primarily fed by Prickly Pear Creek and Silver Creek. It was formed when Hauser Dam was constructed on the Missouri River in 1911. The underwater features of Lake Helena have not yet been documented, and in order to collect research-grade sediment cores, groundwater springs and historic stream channels, ponds, and wetlands need to be mapped. Research-grade cores need to be collected from the lake so they can be used to reconstruct the paleoclimate of the Helena Valley, and in order to get the most complete record cores need to be sampled from areas of low disturbance such as wetlands and ponds that haven’t dried out. Bathymetry and estimated sediment depth were mapped using dual frequency sonar that collected 160,000 data points on a 50 meter grid. Approximate locations of ponds, wetlands, and streams were identified on an 1899 USGS topographic map. The historic map was matched and scaled to current satellite imagery using public land survey section corners in Autodesk Civil3D. The location of one large historic pond has already been verified through sediment coring and has been identified as a possible groundwater spring. This research has also found an unusual area of 10-15 meter deep sediments in the northwest corner of the lake. Future sediment coring will continue to verify the locations of various mapped features and potentially discover the cause of the deep sediments."
"Keetyn Sayers, Jamie Pickens, Natalie Neveau",Nursing,Night Shift Nursing and Breast Cancer Risk: A Comprehensive Analysis,"Working 12-hour shifts or more during the day is something that is normal to the healthcare population. New evidence has come to light that shows that abnormal disruptions in circadian sleep rhythms along with the exposure to artificial light at night may have carcinogenic qualities that could put shift workers at an increased risk of cancer. Looking at the different types of  cancers, the most prevalent diagnosis among night shift healthcare workers appears to be breast cancer. But, because there is a need for health care services 24 hours a day, it's inevitable that a portion of healthcare professionals will work night shifts and therefore be subjected to its potential risks. The purpose of our evidenced-based review is to determine if there is an increased cancer risk for healthcare workers who work night shifts compared to healthcare workers who work day shifts. In determining whether or not there are health risks, facilities who employ night shift workers can implement screenings and protocols that would safeguard the health of their workers. This research will be extremely vital to the healthcare field because it will aid in early detection and prevention of cancer for this group."
"Sydney Gannon, Elliot Wald",Biochemistry,The Effects of Curcumin on the Response of Tetrahymena thermophila to Oxidative Stress,"Studies have shown that curcumin, the active ingredient in turmeric, helps organisms recover from oxidative stress. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this benefit are not well understood. Exposing the model organism Tetrahymena thermophila (T. thermophila) to curcumin allowed for genetic and behavioral investigations into curcumin’s impact on stressed cells. Based on previous research, it was hypothesized that T. thermophila treated with curcumin would be better protected against oxidative stress, as indicated by higher OXR1 expression levels, lower Rad51 expression levels, increased growth, faster speed, and less interest in oxygen when compared to controls. The T. thermophila genes OXR1 and Rad51 are involved in the oxidative stress response as they encode protective factors against stress (OXR1) and DNA damage repair proteins (Rad51). In this study, three experimental groups were established to determine how oxidative stress, induced by hydrogen peroxide, was impacted by curcumin treatment. During the 48 hour treatment period, cell counts were taken to determine growth trajectories followed by cell motility and aerotaxis assays to examine cell viability. Following the behavioral assays, Reverse-Transcription quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to determine the expression of OXR1 and Rad51. Because curcumin protects organisms from oxidative stress, it was predicted that the presence of curcumin would increase OXR1 expression to enhance cellular protection and decrease Rad51 expression due to decreased DNA damage in T. thermophila. It was also predicted that T. thermophila treated with curcumin would better survive in an oxygen deprived environment and exhibit healthy behaviors."
Jack England,Health Science,Surgical versus Non-Surgical Treatment for Lumbar Disc Herniation,"Objective. To review current literature on the effectiveness of non-surgical treatment compared to surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniations (LDH). Methods. Literature identified through Pubmed, CINAHL, and Google Scholar was reviewed regarding the effectiveness of each type of treatment, nonsurgical (e.g. physical therapy) and surgical (e.g. microdiscectomy), and comparing the outcomes of each treatment. Results. All studies found improvement in symptoms through both surgical and nonsurgical treatment for LDH, although the majority of literature found better improved outcomes in patients who underwent surgical treatment, vs. nonsurgical treatment. Participants in seven out of the eight studies were found to have better outcomes in low back or leg pain, physical function,  and quality of life as a result of surgical treatment. Conclusions. Surgical treatment for lumbar disc herniations is associated with a better improvement of quality of life, physical function, and low back or leg pain compared to non-surgical treatment. Alternative outcomes such as negative effects of each treatment, as well as long vs. short term effects of each treatment should be studied further.

"Brittney Chapman, Samuel Conner",Psychology,The Impacts of Stress on Working Memory,"Previous research suggests physical stress has an impact on a person’s memory. In order to better illustrate the impact, this study focuses on the link between stress and auditory working memory. Working memory describes the ability to take in information, hold it for a short period of time, and then utilize that information on a subsequent task. Deficits in this specific type of memory can impact a person’s ability to follow directions and maintain conversation, along with other components of daily functioning. In the classroom, this can appear as having difficulties finishing assignments with many steps or having trouble remaining engaged during a lecture. During the study, participants (N=43) were divided into two groups. One group was exposed to stress (plunged their hand into an ice bath), while the other group was not administered any stress. Both groups were read a list of words from the Deese, Roediger, and McDermott (DRM) task and after 15 seconds were asked to write down as many of the words as they could remember. The mean number of words remembered by each group was compared and results showed the ice bath had a significant effect on the participants' auditory working memory. These observations add to the body of research regarding the negative effects of stress on working memory."
Reagan Paris,History,Irene of Athens & Theodora the Armenian: The Overlooked Heroes of the Byzantine Iconoclast Controversy,"In this paper I discuss the impact the empresses Irene of Athens and Theodora the Armenian had on the political and spiritual thinking of medieval Byzantium. I argue that these women, who brought both periods of Byzantine Iconoclasm to an end, demonstrated a political savviness and spiritual understanding that was not typically credited to women of the medieval world. Using both primary and secondary source documents, I examine the political and spiritual views of both empresses to create an understanding not only of what it meant to hold so much spiritual power, but also how they were able to navigate the struggles of being women in the male dominated sphere of Byzantine politics."
"Macie Frans, Kaitlynn Ayers",Biology,Ecological Impacts on Dermacentor andersoni Abundance and Socioeconomic Impacts on Dermacentor Disease Incidence,"Colorado Tick Fever Virus (CTFV), Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF), tularemia, Q Fever, and anaplasmosis are endemic to western North America. The vector for these diseases are Dermacentor ticks, which are located across Montana. In other states, D. andersoni abundance was found to be correlated with elevation and other environmental factors. Abundance of Dermacentor ticks can increase disease incidence, and may also be associated with socioeconomic factors. Health disparities impact disadvantaged populations through preventable differences in disease burden and health opportunities. RMSF and Lyme disease have shown associations between incidence rates and social determinants of health (SDOH). This project tests for associations between SDOH and Dermacentor disease incidence and between environmental factors and D. andersoni abundance in Montana. Data on tick abundance was collected across 156 sites in Montana from 2013-2017. Random stratified sampling of D. andersoni occurred across three ecoregions: grasslands, intermountain valleys, and the Rocky Mountains. The abundance of ticks was organized into categorical levels. GIS elevation data was acquired from the EROS Data Center. Montana’s Department of Public Health and Human Services reports communicable diseases by county, and identified 30 counties with Dermacentor tick diseases from 2014-2018. Correlation analysis was used to test association between disease incidence and SDOH. Data for socioeconomic factors comes from the 2020 census. Using ANOVA and correlation analysis, we will present findings on the association between elevation and other environmental factors and D. andersoni abundance and SDOH and Dermacentor disease incidence in Montana."
Noah Lohar,Chemistry,Studies Towards the Acceleration of Diels-Alder Reactions using ?6-metal Arene Complex Substituents,"The Diels-Alder (DA) reaction is a cycloaddition reaction between a conjugated diene and a two-atom ? system (dienophile) that forms an unsaturated six-membered ring. DA reactions under normal electron demand conditions (diene is electron rich) are limited by the dienophile requiring an electron-withdrawing group (EWG) to proceed at a reasonable rate. These EWGs, in short, are functional groups conjugated with the ? system that can act as a ? acceptor, most commonly nitriles, carbonyl functional groups (e.g. ketones,esters, etc.), and nitro groups. The complexation of a monocationic (??5-cyclopentadienyl)metal fragment (CpM+) to the ? system of a benzenoid compound in an ??6 configuration results in significant electron withdrawal from substituents attached to the aryl ring. This functionality, therefore, may expand the applicability of the Diels-Alder reaction to progress by utilizing the CpM(??6-aryl) substituent to serve as an activating dienophile substituent. The formation of a DA adduct between CpRu(?6-ethyl trans-cinnamate)PF6 and 2,3-dimethyl-1,3-butadiene was successful as observed by 1H NMR. Characterization of the adduct has been assigned on the basis of 13C NMR, 1H NMR, and IR spectra. This research also explored the synthesis of an analogous iron complex, CpFe(?6-ethyl trans-cinnamate)PF6, to accelerate DA reactions. Compared to ruthenium, iron offers many advantages primarily due to its abundance compared to ruthenium. Herein we report our progress in synthesizing CpFe(?6-ethyl trans-cinnamate)PF6."
Mikenna Deschamps,Hispanic Studies,Setting Fire to the View of Women in Politics through Ana Mendieta's Silueta en Fuego,"Through the Silueta series, a collection of silhouettes crafted in Iowa and Mexico between 1973 and 1978, the Cuban-American artist Ana Mendieta tells her personal story of all she endured throughout her childhood while advocating for women’s rights. One of her most influential silhouettes, the Silueta en Fuego (“Silhouette on Fire”), is a powerful depiction of a woman’s body on fire, demonstrating the drive to change how gender is perceived in politics today. Mendieta’s use of natural elements to mold her works demonstrates the connection between women and nature as both are described as symbols of beauty and strength deserving of admiration and respect. Regarding art’s form, in The Aesthetic Dimension Herbert Marcuse argues that “I see the political potential of art in art itself, in the aesthetic form as such. Furthermore, I argue that by virtue of its aesthetic form, art is largely autonomous vis a vis the given social rela­tions.” But how does the aesthetic form of a work of art participate in the political configuration of gender today? In my presentation, I will demonstrate that Ana’s use of the aesthetic form in her Silueta en Fuego personifies the power of nature and women. Also, I will prove that in Silueta en Fuego fire gives women the transformative power to change the ideas of gender diving deeper into the true essence of a woman."
Faith Derby,Nursing,Infection Rates with Urinary Devices,"In 2015, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported urinary tract infections (UTI) accounted for 62,700 infections in acute hospitals. Most UTIs are caused from catheter associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) resulting in complications such as prolonged hospital stays, increased cost, and mortality. The Foley catheter is the most common internal urinary catheter (IUC) and consists of a tube that is inserted through the urethra, into the bladder, where urine then drains into a bag outside of the body. In recent years, a new device, a female external urinary device (FEUD), was developed as an alternative to IUCs in women. These external devices adhere to the labia with the use of continuous suction and divert urine away from the body into a canister. The purpose of this Evidence- Based Practice review is to compare infection rates of FEUDs and IUCs on CAUTIs in the female population. The outcome of this study can assist nurses with reducing CAUTIs in female patients needing a urinary device, leading to better patient outcomes."
Ryan Johnson,Data Science,Optimizing College Schedules with Genetic Algorithms,"Genetic algorithms are a unique and powerful way to find solutions to problems so complex they are impossible to solve by hand. These algorithms find their inspiration in the field of biology, based upon the concepts of natural selection. Using processes that mimic mating, gene pools, and mutation, these algorithms find a solution close to, if not exactly, an optimal solution. One practical use of these genetic algorithms is to provide better scheduling services for a college attempting to assign courses to classrooms and available time slots. In this project, I will expand upon a basic genetic algorithm to demonstrate how to create a better semester course schedule for Carroll College."
Ryan Cain,Mathematics,An Exploration of Lie Theory,"Lie theory involves the study of Lie groups, Lie algebras, and their representations. A Lie group is a manifold G, equipped with a smooth group operation × such that G × G --> G. Some of these groups, such as the orthogonal On(K), special linear SLn(K), special orthogonal SO(n), and special unitary SU(n) groups where K is in {R, C, H}, can be represented as matrices G with G as a subset of the general linear group GLn(R). Generally, such representations of G on a Euclidean space Rn are defined as a group homomorphism from G to GLn(R). A Lie algebra g of these matrix groups G is defined as the tangent space to G at the identity I, denoted g(G)=TI(G). These concepts bridge algebra and geometry, and show up in many places in physics, particularly when studying systems with continuous symmetry."
Alyx Gage,History,Italian Renaissance: The Creation of the Provocative Lucifer,"The Italian Renaissance brought forth an explosion of science, invention, literature, and art. The artists wanted to breathe new life into the classical art of the Greeks and Romans. Through this, they found a fascination in the body and proudly displayed what they had deemed the ideal body in their works. This attention to realistic bodies and presentation of them unclothed would still affect artists hundreds of years later. A key example is that of the L'ange du mal and the Genie du mal. This presentation will address the thematic connection between these statutes and Renaissance artwork. Through the press and church’s reaction to the statues, it will also address how the true meaning of art is often overlooked when faced with art that society has deemed ‘provocative’ or ‘inappropriate’ specifically regarding the human body."
Finlay Bates,Political Science,Do Non-Partisan Elections Yield More Qualified Judicial Candidates?,"A study involving four states, two with partisan judicial elections and two with non-partisan judicial elections. The comparisons uses 2 large states and two small states: The large states are Texas (partisan) and Minnesota (non-partisan). The small states are New Mexico (partisan) and Montana (non-partisan). It is meant to discern which system for electing candidates results in more qualified elected state supreme court justices. The study was conducted using criteria from the American Bar Association and other third-party judge rating sources. I use a scoring system that takes the following into account: Clerkship, years of practice, education level, School/institution, political experience, supreme court cases, # of won elections at the federal or state supreme court level, and the number of times they were elected to a lower state court. The study adds to the literature on the quality of candidates in our increasingly polarizing world. Some conclusions have been reached about the data collected; in larger states, the difference in scores between the elected candidates and the losing candidates was not significant. But in the small states, where there is less competition, the partisan state elected the less qualified candidate, while in non-partisan Montana, the more qualified candidate was chosen by the vote. The other observation that came from my research is that in states with partisan elections seats on the State Supreme Court were more likely to be contended for."
Josie Gale,Honors Scholar,Challenged by Atrocity: Letting the Holocaust Challenge Our Operative Moral Frameworks,"Atrocities like the Holocaust force us as a society to confront who we are and how we understand ourselves. Primo Levi's Survival in Auschwitz offers us a narrative of his experience as a prisoner in the Auschwitz concentration camp. His powerful recollection of daily life in the camp raises critical questions about what it means to be human and compels us to challenge some of our long-standing operative moral frameworks. One example of an operative moral framework comes from Augustine of Hippo, whose understanding of the human condition presented in his autobiography Confessions, has long informed our Western imagination. After contemplating Levi’s experience in Auschwitz, I ask: can Augustine’s take on the human condition, his notion of the good, and the role of free will be applied to all moral situations? What about situations where people are physically enslaved and in bondage or victimhood from serious trauma? Is Augustine’s framework still applicable today? Grappling with these questions in light of these two texts, I hope to demonstrate how the extreme evil witnessed and the trauma caused by the Holocaust must challenge our moral imaginations if we hope to learn from these atrocities and build more just societies."
Andrew Devine,Philosophy,"Ignorance is not Bliss, Truth is","We live in a world where learning is increasingly devalued unless it brings about some economic benefit. In this world ignorance is often seen as bliss and knowledge a hindrance to happiness. In my presentation I will seek to answer questions such as, is knowledge good for its own sake or is it only good in so far as it is useful? And, why ignorance seems to be bliss? I will argue that knowledge is good apart from its usefulness because truth is our end and that thing which brings us happiness, and that we are made to both know and love the truth."
Abby Robo,Gender Studies,The Status and Reception of Female Agricultural Workers in ¬1910s Rural Montana,"After her husband Gustave died in a mining accident in Alberta, Canada, she was left to raise her three children and sustain their homestead all on her own. This research aims to theorize what life was like for her as an immigrant in a small town on the Hi-Line of Montana, raising her children in an ethnic enclave of Estonian immigrants. Records of Emma Roboweitra’s life experiences will be analyzed in light of works by theorists like Simone De Beauvoir, Paula England, and Luce Irigaray who have written on the broad experiences of women. Using these and further research on the historical role of women in agriculture, this research examines what life was like for Emma Roboweitra and others situated like her, getting to the bottom of what her status was like and the reception from others in her community.

Nathan Hicks,Psychology,Reclaiming Serenity: How outdoor experiences may help improve Veterans' mental health,"Many individuals claim that being outdoors can help improve mental health. However, most research focuses on treatment as usual with nature-based therapies as an addition or complement. Previous research indicates that nature-based therapies may be beneficial in alleviating symptoms associated with trauma, depression, and anxiety (Gelkopf et al., 2013; Merchand et al., 2018). Recently, evidence has suggested that just being in nature may help to reduce anxiety and improve overall mental health symptoms (Wheeler et al., 2020). The current study analyzed results from 32 Veterans who completed a set of questionnaires both before and after a five-day outdoor adventure at a cabin on the Big Hole River in Montana. Veterans were administered the PTSD Checklist (PCL-5), State and Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-6), and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC-25) two weeks before the 5-day trip, and two weeks after the 5-day trip. Preliminary results suggest that overall mental health symptoms significantly improved following the 5-day adventure. Anxiety, both state and trait, significantly improved after the trip. PTSD symptoms significantly improved, and resiliency ratings increased. This study suggests that a five-day outdoor trip may significantly enhance Veterans' mental health, highlighting nature's role in reducing stress and improving well-being. The findings prompt further investigation into the longevity of these mental health improvements."
June LePage,Honors Scholar,Speaking for Ourselves: Women in History and Literature Rejecting Dominant Narratives on the Human Condition,"Until recently, the experiences and voices of women have predominantly been excluded, undermined, and ignored in western discourse on the human condition. The result of this is that men have historically dominated the conversation, and often hijacked the wisdom and contributions of women, making the male experience the normative and narrow definition of what it means to be human. An example of men undermining the narratives of women is illustrated in Praise of Folly by Desiderius Erasmus (1509) and his feminized personification of foolishness. The interjection of a man's thoughts into the image of a woman is not an uncommon phenomenon. Men's portrayal of women as figures such as Lady Liberty, Columbia, Lady Philosophy, or Mother Nature, reflects an idolized version of womanhood that ignores the reality of women's experience and leaves us with a skewed understanding of the human condition. In her 1792 work A Vindication of the Rights of Woman with Structures on Political and Moral Subjects, Mary Wollstonecraft challenges this narrative. By inserting herself into the European intellectual conversation of the time, Wollstonecraft argues how preempting a woman's experience does a great disservice to her and humanity in general. When Wollstonecraft prompts other authors to write and think in more nuanced and liberated fashions, later authors like Zora Neal Hurston embody the reclaiming of the feminine image and feminine voice by writing to reflect real women’s experiences as complex and dynamic humans. In her narrative Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), she speaks to a woman’s wisdom with the life of her character Janie, whom society tries to constrain as a black woman. Janie’s story illustrates the intersectionality and complexity of human nature that has been ignored for far too long; Wollstonecraft calls all women to help deconstruct the oppressive dominant narratives penned and perpetuated by men. By exploring Hurston’s novel, this presentation will argue that Wollstonecraft’s insightful critique continues to be relevant and challenge us today."

Anzhela Stoliar,Gender Studies,The #MeToo Movement and Its Effect on Women’s Representation in Vogue,"Social movements influence mass media and force them to change to stay relevant to their audience. At the same time, mass media shows shifts happening in the world and thus affects how people perceive one issue or another.  Vogue is a worldwide popular magazine for women that mostly focuses on fashion but also covers other areas such as culture, TV shows, and so on. The recent research focused on analyzing the representation of women in Vogue in general by discussing under- or misrepresentation. This study seeks to determine if the #MeToo movement, which allowed victims of sexual harassment to get their voices heard, had influenced Vogue's representation of women in their magazines one year after the movement started. The study examines the front page of Vogue magazine from five different countries from different regions of the world. The findings show that the front page of Vogue magazine has not changed since the #MeToo movement started, and the images presented on the front page still reinforce messages of weakness, vulnerability, and sexualization of women."
"Martha Schwarz, Chloe Gallagher",Engineering,Lincoln Airport Tie-Downs,"The Montana Department of Transportation (MDT) Aeronautics Division brought an airport campground tie-down project to the Carroll College Engineering class, Senior Design Project. MDT Aeronautics was seeking assistance in the design of permanent tie-downs at the grass campground parking area at Lincoln Airport in Lincoln, MT. Within the project description, the team was tasked with determining the location to place tie-downs and quantity to include in the layout, if earthwork is required, and the type of tie-downs. There were two categories of alternatives evaluated by the team to meet the expectations of the project sponsor. The two categories are the method of laying concrete, pre-cast or on-site pour, and the anchor, mooring eye, D-ring, or cable. When determining the method of laying concrete the team looked at the feasibility and cost of both options and determined an on-site pour would be the suitable option for this project. This decision was made on the basis that the quantity of concrete needed per tie-down and the number of tie-downs was too small to justify the cost of custom precast blocks. A part of making the concrete method decision was deciding what style of anchor would be the most appropriate for the parking area. This was determined by cost, design life, and needed maintenance. After an analysis of the three anchors, it was determined that the mooring eye, although slightly more expensive, has the longest design life and the least amount of required maintenance. The mooring eye and on-site pour concrete are the most effective designs to fit the sponsors' needs. The mooring eye is the place for pilots to fasten straps to anchor the aircraft. There is a metal grove with a bar across, acting as a place to feed the tie-down straps through the groove and tie off to the metal bar. Mooring eyes are the most commonly used tie-down at airports. The mooring eyes will need to be purchased and brought to the site. During the time of construction, the mooring eyes will be embedded into the concrete during the on-site pour. The on-site pour of concrete is the most economically feasible option. The pour has less variability and can be customized to meet the needs of the project. The concrete mix and shape of the embedded block will be designed based on the forces the anchors are required to withstand from uplift on the aircraft. The final layout will include at most 6 parking spots, each with three anchoring points. Aircraft will be required to push the aircraft into or out of their respective parking space. The final design will be completed by May 2024. The final design report will include a site map, material quantities, cost evaluation, and design plans"
Megan Olsen,Hispanic Studies,Pablo Neruda: The Power of Words from a Figure of Poetic Political Potential,"Pablo Neruda is an internationally recognized poet, accredited especially for his political poetry. His use of poetry to remark on the political environments of Latin America has made his work popular amongst many, in both good and bad ways. This is illustrated in the movie, Neruda, directed by Pablo Larraín, which depicts the story of this controversial poet leadingpoet leading to his desired arrest. Much of this conflict is reflected in his book of poems, canto general. Within this are two poems which specifically demonstrate his strong political stance: los dictadores and La United Fruit Co. This theme of using his artistic status to communicate his political ideas invokes the conversation of political potential in art. Ana María Pérez Rubio explains the rise of the influence of political themes in art, and the power and effect that the use of art can have in political communication. So, I propose the question: what can we learn about the power of words within the works of Neruda? Neruda uses his poetry to present political commentary and critiques of Chilean politics, as demonstrated in his poems, los dictadores and La United Fruit Co, and the power of his works are confirmed in the fear he invokes in the Chilean government, as demonstrated in the Neruda the movie."
Luke Ostberg,Honors Scholar,Only True Love of God Can Set the Human Free,"Desiderius Erasmus’s Praise of Folly and the Song of Songs from the Old Testament show love’s capacity for filling life and giving it joyful purpose. In a theme of abandonment, Praise of Folly demonstrates that the most foolish lovers are Christians and that their foolishness makes them the most free people from worldly concerns and misery. In a different manner, the Song of Songs shows two lovers who abandon themselves to each other such that they only care for the other and lose all worries about themselves. This example of perfect abandonment in spousal love is an allegory to the love that exists between Christ and the Church and between Christ and the Christian. In these interpretations, both of these texts imply that the most joyful and free life comes from a giving over of self to the best of lovers, who is God. In giving over ourselves to God, we lose self interest and find ourselves entirely interested in God, who is a lover that does care for and provide for our self. This presentation will demonstrate that only a true and abandoning love of God allows us to be free from the burdens and misery of self-interest, free to live life in joy with God."
Maile Coleman,Hispanic Studies,"The Hope in Memory in A Twelve-Year Night, by Álvaro Brechner","The film A Twelve-Year Night, by the Uruguayan director Álvaro Brechner, narrates the real story of the captivity of three revolutionaries of the Tupamaros guerilla. These rebels, one of whom would be the future president of Uruguay, were imprisoned by the regime of Juan María Bordaberry’s civic-military dictatorship, and kept in uncommunicated confinement for twelve years. These three men lived in a manner in which no human should ever live, but they visited their memories in order to survive with hope. According to Jorge Majfud in “The Memories of  Oblivion'', “[la] mayor virtud [del cine Latinoamericano] es la interrogación, la trascendencia más allá del hecho cinematográfico: el rescate de la memoria colectiva” (“[the] greatest virtue [of Latin American cinema] is the interrogation, the transcendence beyond the cinematographic fact: the rescue of the collective memory”).  Taking into account that in this film we witness these men cling to their memories, as well as to the collective memories of their country before the civic-military dictatorship, we can ask how can the collective memory of life before captivity inspire these men in a time of oppression and corruption? In this essay I affirm that in A Twelve-Year Night we can explore how the hope that memory gave these three men influenced their resistance. Also, I will reveal how, through their collective memory, the men found hope in the midst of the statism of their stolen time. Finally, I will demonstrate that this hope then feeds resistance in an age of oppression and corruption."
Ariana Collins,Catholic Studies,Caritas in Dolores: Love in Sorrows,"There is a particular fragility to human life,  in the sense that all human persons are subject to experience suffering. The question of suffering being one that for centuries has perplexed the human mind. In  this study I seek to engage said question in a theological sense. Exploring the nature of suffering with Christ, united to the cross. Moreover, illuminating the ways in which suffering with Christ frees the soul to love Christ (and others) more profoundly. Oftentimes in enduring pain and strife (moments coinciding with suffering) the subject turns inward. In this way they limit their capacity to receive and give love. In suffering with Christ, one increases their capacity to receive and give love. In this study I explore then the purgative nature of suffering with Christ, its matrimonial and procreative nature. Indicating how love in suffering is a vocation in itself that is done in the littleness of everyday life."
Steven Santos,Nursing,Infection Incidence in Invasive Procedures: Evaluating the Impact of Sterile and Clean Techniques,"Infection incidence during invasive procedures in modern healthcare poses a pressing concern, necessitating an examination of techniques used to mitigate infection risks. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1 in every 31 patients acquires a healthcare-associated infection (HAI) each day, with an estimate of 687,000 yearly in the U.S.. Moreover, among these estimates, roughly 72,000 patients die during their HAI hospitalization each year. In addition to the morbidity rates, HAIs require extended medical interventions, medications and further care resulting in the hospital incurring billions of dollars in excess health care costs. Invasive procedures within the healthcare industry carry a risk for infection, thus the optimal approach to minimize infection necessitates the need for a comprehensive evaluation. Sterile technique involves adherence to aseptic, free from contamination, procedures that aim at eliminating all microorganisms from the procedural environment. In contrast, clean technique is characterized by the prioritization of cleanliness without achieving sterility, or the complete elimination of microorganisms within the procedure.  The purpose of this review is to focus on infection incidence and infection control by examining the comparative effectiveness of sterile versus clean technique within the context of patients undergoing invasive procedures. The synthesis of these research findings should drive substantive changes for nursing and other healthcare providers by enhancing patient safety and facilitating optimal infection protocols within the clinical setting."
"David Wassmuth, Jim Wong",Engineering,Stanford Airport Taxilane Design,"Stanford Airport/Biggerstaff Field is pursuing construction of additional airplane storage and parking to increase airport revenue. To accomplish this, new taxi lanes are required to provide locations for future hangars and aprons. Robert Peccia and Associates (RPA) approached the Carroll College Senior Engineering Design class to create a detailed location and pavement design analysis. This project is located just south of the town of Stanford Montana. Currently our team has determined the location and layout of the taxi lanes by evaluating different location alternatives and comparing cost analyses at each location. Economical, societal, and environmental aspects of each design were considered and classified to determine the best design for each of these concerns. The selected location requires minimum demolition of existing structures and also creates the least unnecessary runway traffic. To complete the design, we must produce cost-effective and useful pavement design as well as provide detailed engineering drawings to ensure accurate construction of the project. To complete this, we used the FAA-approved pavement design software, FAARFIELD, as well as Autodesk products to create high-quality, professional engineering designs. Using the work completed last semester as well as the skills and software necessary to complete this semester, we created and will present a robust engineering design of the Stanford Airport taxi lanes that is cost-effective, feasible, ethical, and satisfies the needs of the project owners."
Erin Welter,Gender Studies,An Analysis of American Westernization and Its Influence on Germany and Rwanda in the Aftermath of War and Genocide,"The purpose of this research is to analyze inclusive measures in policy of countries that received aid from the United States after genocide and war. Specifically, if these measures have the intention of centering women in political representation. Data was collected from internet sources on Google Scholar and the Carroll College Academic Databases to research this. The results show that German political female representation is currently 34.92% of Parliament, placing it 42nd in the world, while the Rwandan Parliament is 61%, placing it 1st for women in Parliament. The United States has a percentage of 28% women, and the global average is 25.8%. The findings also show that the idea of a woman’s role in society has been affected by the conflict each country has gone through. This suggests that Westernized ideas from the United States might have fueled reform. However, it would appear that Germany and Rwanda have surpassed America in political inclusivity based on gender."
Lucas Dawson,Nursing,Optimizing Ventilation: Evaluating Tidal Volumes with Adult vs. Pediatric Bag Valve Masks,"During cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) the bag valve mask (BVM) is commonly used to provide manual ventilation. With more than 356,000 out-of-hospital cardiac arrests every year, proper ventilations with the BVM is imperative. Excessive ventilation with a BVM can lead to barotrauma, volutrauma, and lung damage, leading to poor patient outcomes. Currently, BVMs have the capacity to deliver large tidal volumes that exceed lung protective thresholds. This increases the risk of barotrauma and volutrauma. Adult BVMs have volumes of 1000mL and pediatric BVMs between 450-650mL. The average adult male has a tidal volume of 500mL and females an average of 400mL. The purpose of this Evidence-Based Research is to assess whether using pediatric BVMs versus adult BVMs results in tidal volumes within lung protective volumes. Nurses and healthcare providers can use this information to deliver appropriate tidal volumes with the BVM. Physiologically appropriate tidal volumes reduce the risk of lung injury and improve patient outcomes. Understanding the differences between the adult and pediatric BVM can guide clinical practice to align with lung protective strategies."
Megan Olsen,Honors Scholar,The Role of Knowledge Examined Through Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus and Eliot’s The Waste Land,"This presentation reflects an investigation into the roles and limitations of human knowledge as evidenced by Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus and T.S. Eliot’s The Waste Land. Through Doctor Faustus’ questioning of the limits of knowledge and discernment of whether to endeavor into understanding beyond what is seen as acceptable by societal norms, the tragedy highlights the struggle to balance the conflicting pursuits between devotion to divinity and an inherent curiosity for proliferation of knowledge. Though both texts explore the role of knowledge, they are different in context. While Doctor Faustus is faced with barriers which challenge the role of knowledge in his personal experience, T.S. Eliot presents a fragmented and complex poem which leads one to wonder about the purpose of knowledge in the context of a broken and incoherent world. This contrast provides opportunity for analysis and ultimate conclusion on the roles of knowledge in the human experience across varied conditions. Whether limited by societal expectations or considered from the perspective of a broken and devastated society, the role of knowledge can be theorized through analysis of Marlow’s and Eliot’s works."
Laura Fontaine,Hispanic Studies,No and The Twelve-Year Night: The Concept of Resistance and Its Impact on Conflicts and Hope,"Two movies, No, by Pablo Larraín, and  A Twelve Year Night, by Álvaro Brechner, take place in Chile and Uruguay, during the dictators Augusto Pinochet and Juan María Bordaberry. The first describes a political campaign, consisting of television commercials against the election of Pinochet, who wanted to rule for another eight years. The second movie tells the story of three prisoners, who were captives and tortured for twelve years because they resisted the government. The characters from both movies used different means to resist oppression, and therefore, their results were different. A theme that is present in the two movies is the importance of resistance against the government, oppression, injustice, and other issues that negatively affect people. Jorge Majfud describes that, “cinema, although it could be considered, like all art...a critical and accusatory instrument, it is also a reflection of the society in which it immerses.” These ideas bring us to question, what effects do the different forms of resistance in society have, and how do they impact conflicts and a person’s hope? This essay will reveal how No and A Twelve Year Night teach us that all forms have importance. Additionally, that there are ways to resist with actions, and the lack thereof. Finally, in this essay, I will explore how these movies demonstrate how all forms of resistance have the possibility to give hope to people that are suffering and oppressed. The most necessary piece is to resist and stand up for what you believe in."
Nicole Morgen,Mathematics,Evaluating Predictors for the 2022 World Cup Using Decision Trees and Random Forests,"The FIFA 2022 World Cup was home to exciting upsets, devastating losses and unexpected results. FIFA rankings and past performance statistics were insufficient predictors for results, advancements and performances in the World Cup. In this project, machine learning algorithms and predictors beyond rankings and past performances will be used to predict the results of the Qatar 2022 World Cup. The FIFA ranking prediction method will serve as a baseline for accuracy. The two machine learning algorithms that will be considered for this project are Decision Trees and Random Forests, the latter of which can determine the validity of various parameters. It is the goal of this project to accurately predict the results of the 2022 Qatar World Cup and develop a sophisticated model that can be applied to future World Cups. "

Luke Ostberg,Philosophy,An Attempt to Understand the Unity of the Divine Identities of God as Love and God as Truth,"Within Christian Philosophy, two seemingly contrary identities of God are held to be one: “God is love” and “God is truth.” “God is love”, especially in the context that God as Christ lived as a man and died as a man, implies a changing nature that can suffer. Alternatively, “God is truth” implies an eternally unchanging reality of God. How do these two identities unite, and what does their unity look like? In this research, I attempt to approach an understanding of how this unity works through analogies of the human person to God. Looking at the will-intellect structure of the soul and love’s unifying nature, I show how God’s unity of love and truth can potentially be seen in examples relating to these human features."
Carrie Nelson,History,Andean History's Effect on Cultural Attitudes Towards Medicine,"The Andean region presents a complex history riddled with racial inequality, dramatic class separation and centuries of traumatic violence. Spanish colonization, independence and refining identity in a postcolonial era, twentieth century dictatorships and modern systems that uphold previous inequalities, have all defined Andean culture. These key defining historical periods have formed subcultural attitudes towards medicine in the countries within the Andean region. This research presents both how historical events have created medical practices and how post-colonial history has shaped modern attitudes towards medical practices. Through anecdotal field evidence and substantial research that includes case study evaluation of medical practices, I demonstrate how systemic inequalities and abuse have created distrust and led to a class, geographical and racial-based schism in attitudes towards medical practices."
"Dylan Stearns, Haley Luchini, Alexa Dryer",Nursing,The Relationship Between Diet and the Age of Menarche,"When thinking about the early onset of a menarche, diet might not be the first consideration that comes to mind. School-aged and young adolescent females are faced with several physiological changes during puberty. Through a comparison of a plant-based diet and a regular diet, the determination will be made if a regular diet, where meat and dairy are consumed regularly, will have a direct influence over the start of early menarche. Based on the research and findings, the hypothesis is that a regular diet that includes daily consumption of red meat and dairy products will cause early menarche. Early menarche is defined as before the age of 12, the national average of puberty. By identifying diet associated risk factors on a young woman’s body, this research strives to lower the consequences of precocious puberty that can affect these women later on in  life. Some of these consequences include an increased risk of breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cardiometabolic health as well as type two diabetes. The purpose of this Evidence-Based Practice review is to provide educational tools for nurses to provide to parents on nutrition selections, in the hope to provide early interventions in early menarche."
Anna Brown,English/Honors Scholar,The Eye as the Tool in Our Pursuit of Knowledge,"The eye has long held a special place in Western thought/philosophy as a symbol of how human beings perceive and construct knowledge. The use of the eye was essential in Renaissance art and literature, as artists and authors emphasized a needed skepticism of medieval frameworks. The eye is an important symbol for the construction of knowledge. For example,  John Milton’s Paradise Lost explores the eye’s role as both a tool that gets us closer to truth and as an obstacle because our vices obscure our ability to see clearly. As the emphasis on the eye as a tool for knowledge became more prevalent, its limitations also became more evident, especially in post-war, twentieth-century Europe. T.S Eliot’s “The Wasteland” certainly emphasizes the role of the eye in meaning-making. Still, he also suggests that Western societies must confront the limits of their perception within their Western frameworks. Eliot calls for Western society and Europe specifically to recognize the complexities of pursuing knowledge where the eye is only one of many tools that should be used in the pursuit of knowledge. When we acknowledge both the uses and the limits of the eye in our construction of knowledge, we are better equipped to humbly and thoughtfully critique our operative epistemological frameworks amid an ever-changing world."
